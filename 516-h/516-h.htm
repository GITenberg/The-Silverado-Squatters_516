<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
SILVERADO SQUATTERS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene of this little book is on
a high mountain.&nbsp; There are, indeed, many higher; there are
many of a nobler outline.&nbsp; It is no place of pilgrimage for
the summary globe-trotter; but to one who lives upon its sides,
Mount Saint Helena soon becomes a centre of interest.&nbsp; It is
the Mont Blanc of one section of the Californian Coast Range,
none of its near neighbours rising to one-half its
altitude.&nbsp; It looks down on much green, intricate
country.&nbsp; It feeds in the spring-time many splashing
brooks.&nbsp; From its summit you must have an excellent lesson
of geography: seeing, to the south, San Francisco Bay, with
Tamalpais on the one hand and Monte Diablo on the other; to the
west and thirty miles away, the open ocean; eastward, across the
corn-lands and thick tule swamps of Sacramento Valley, to where
the Central Pacific railroad begins to climb the sides of the
Sierras; and northward, for what I know, the white head of Shasta
looking down on Oregon.&nbsp; Three counties, Napa County, Lake
County, and Sonoma County, march across its cliffy
shoulders.&nbsp; Its naked peak stands nearly four thousand five
hundred feet above the sea; its sides are fringed with forest;
and the soil, where it is bare, glows warm with cinnabar.</p>
<p>Life in its shadow goes rustically forward.&nbsp; Bucks, and
bears, and rattlesnakes, and former mining operations, are the
staple of men&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; Agriculture has only begun to
mount above the valley.&nbsp; And though in a few years from now
the whole district may be smiling with farms, passing trains
shaking the mountain to the heart, many-windowed hotels lighting
up the night like factories, and a prosperous city occupying the
site of sleepy Calistoga; yet in the mean time, around the foot
of that mountain the silence of nature reigns in a great measure
unbroken, and the people of hill and valley go sauntering about
their business as in the days before the flood.</p>
<p>To reach Mount Saint Helena from San Francisco, the traveller
has twice to cross the bay: once by the busy Oakland Ferry, and
again, after an hour or so of the railway, from Vallejo junction
to Vallejo.&nbsp; Thence he takes rail once more to mount the
long green strath of Napa Valley.</p>
<p>In all the contractions and expansions of that inland sea, the
Bay of San Francisco, there can be few drearier scenes than the
Vallejo Ferry.&nbsp; Bald shores and a low, bald islet inclose
the sea; through the narrows the tide bubbles, muddy like a
river.&nbsp; When we made the passage (bound, although yet we
knew it not, for Silverado) the steamer jumped, and the black
buoys were dancing in the jabble; the ocean breeze blew killing
chill; and, although the upper sky was still unflecked with
vapour, the sea fogs were pouring in from seaward, over the
hilltops of Marin county, in one great, shapeless, silver
cloud.</p>
<p>South Vallejo is typical of many Californian towns.&nbsp; It
was a blunder; the site has proved untenable; and, although it is
still such a young place by the scale of Europe, it has already
begun to be deserted for its neighbour and namesake, North
Vallejo.&nbsp; A long pier, a number of drinking saloons, a hotel
of a great size, marshy pools where the frogs keep up their
croaking, and even at high noon the entire absence of any human
face or voice&mdash;these are the marks of South Vallejo.&nbsp;
Yet there was a tall building beside the pier, labelled the
<i>Star Flour Mills</i>; and sea-going, full-rigged ships lay
close along shore, waiting for their cargo.&nbsp; Soon these
would be plunging round the Horn, soon the flour from the <i>Star
Flour Mills</i> would be landed on the wharves of
Liverpool.&nbsp; For that, too, is one of England&rsquo;s
outposts; thither, to this gaunt mill, across the Atlantic and
Pacific deeps and round about the icy Horn, this crowd of great,
three-masted, deep-sea ships come, bringing nothing, and return
with bread.</p>
<p>The Frisby House, for that was the name of the hotel, was a
place of fallen fortunes, like the town.&nbsp; It was now given
up to labourers, and partly ruinous.&nbsp; At dinner there was
the ordinary display of what is called in the west a <i>two-bit
house</i>: the tablecloth checked red and white, the plague of
flies, the wire hencoops over the dishes, the great variety and
invariable vileness of the food and the rough coatless men
devoting it in silence.&nbsp; In our bedroom, the stove would not
burn, though it would smoke; and while one window would not open,
the other would not shut.&nbsp; There was a view on a bit of
empty road, a few dark houses, a donkey wandering with its shadow
on a slope, and a blink of sea, with a tall ship lying anchored
in the moonlight.&nbsp; All about that dreary inn frogs sang
their ungainly chorus.</p>
<p>Early the next morning we mounted the hill along a wooden
footway, bridging one marish spot after another.&nbsp; Here and
there, as we ascended, we passed a house embowered in white
roses.&nbsp; More of the bay became apparent, and soon the blue
peak of Tamalpais rose above the green level of the island
opposite.&nbsp; It told us we were still but a little way from
the city of the Golden Gates, already, at that hour, beginning to
awake among the sand-hills.&nbsp; It called to us over the waters
as with the voice of a bird.&nbsp; Its stately head, blue as a
sapphire on the paler azure of the sky, spoke to us of wider
outlooks and the bright Pacific.&nbsp; For Tamalpais stands
sentry, like a lighthouse, over the Golden Gates, between the bay
and the open ocean, and looks down indifferently on both.&nbsp;
Even as we saw and hailed it from Vallejo, seamen, far out at
sea, were scanning it with shaded eyes; and, as if to answer to
the thought, one of the great ships below began silently to
clothe herself with white sails, homeward bound for England.</p>
<p>For some way beyond Vallejo the railway led us through bald
green pastures.&nbsp; On the west the rough highlands of Marin
shut off the ocean; in the midst, in long, straggling, gleaming
arms, the bay died out among the grass; there were few trees and
few enclosures; the sun shone wide over open uplands, the
displumed hills stood clear against the sky.&nbsp; But by-and-by
these hills began to draw nearer on either hand, and first
thicket and then wood began to clothe their sides; and soon we
were away from all signs of the sea&rsquo;s neighbourhood,
mounting an inland, irrigated valley.&nbsp; A great variety of
oaks stood, now severally, now in a becoming grove, among the
fields and vineyards.&nbsp; The towns were compact, in about
equal proportions, of bright, new wooden houses and great and
growing forest trees; and the chapel bell on the engine sounded
most festally that sunny Sunday, as we drew up at one green town
after another, with the townsfolk trooping in their
Sunday&rsquo;s best to see the strangers, with the sun sparkling
on the clean houses, and great domes of foliage humming overhead
in the breeze.</p>
<p>This pleasant Napa Valley is, at its north end, blockaded by
our mountain.&nbsp; There, at Calistoga, the railroad ceases, and
the traveller who intends faring farther, to the Geysers or to
the springs in Lake County, must cross the spurs of the mountain
by stage.&nbsp; Thus, Mount Saint Helena is not only a summit,
but a frontier; and, up to the time of writing, it has stayed the
progress of the iron horse.</p>
<h2>PART I&mdash;IN THE VALLEY</h2>
<h3><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>CHAPTER I&mdash;CALISTOGA</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult for a European to
imagine Calistoga, the whole place is so new, and of such an
accidental pattern; the very name, I hear, was invented at a
supper-party by the man who found the springs.</p>
<p>The railroad and the highway come up the valley about parallel
to one another.&nbsp; The street of Calistoga joins the
perpendicular to both&mdash;a wide street, with bright, clean,
low houses, here and there a verandah over the sidewalk, here and
there a horse-post, here and there lounging townsfolk.&nbsp;
Other streets are marked out, and most likely named; for these
towns in the New World begin with a firm resolve to grow larger,
Washington and Broadway, and then First and Second, and so forth,
being boldly plotted out as soon as the community indulges in a
plan.&nbsp; But, in the meanwhile, all the life and most of the
houses of Calistoga are concentrated upon that street between the
railway station and the road.&nbsp; I never heard it called by
any name, but I will hazard a guess that it is either Washington
or Broadway.&nbsp; Here are the blacksmith&rsquo;s, the
chemist&rsquo;s, the general merchant&rsquo;s, and Kong Sam Kee,
the Chinese laundryman&rsquo;s; here, probably, is the office of
the local paper (for the place has a paper&mdash;they all have
papers); and here certainly is one of the hotels,
Cheeseborough&rsquo;s, whence the daring Foss, a man dear to
legend, starts his horses for the Geysers.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that we are here in a land of
stage-drivers and highwaymen: a land, in that sense, like England
a hundred years ago.&nbsp; The highway robber&mdash;road-agent,
he is quaintly called&mdash;is still busy in these parts.&nbsp;
The fame of Vasquez is still young.&nbsp; Only a few years go,
the Lakeport stage was robbed a mile or two from Calistoga.&nbsp;
In 1879, the dentist of Mendocino City, fifty miles away upon the
coast, suddenly threw off the garments of his trade, like
Grindoff, in <i>The Miller and his Men</i>, and flamed forth in
his second dress as a captain of banditti.&nbsp; A great robbery
was followed by a long chase, a chase of days if not of weeks,
among the intricate hill-country; and the chase was followed by
much desultory fighting, in which several&mdash;and the dentist,
I believe, amongst the number&mdash;bit the dust.&nbsp; The grass
was springing for the first time, nourished upon their blood,
when I arrived in Calistoga.&nbsp; I am reminded of another
highwayman of that same year.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had been
unwell,&rdquo; so ran his humorous defence, &ldquo;and the doctor
told him to take something, so he took the
express-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cultus of the stage-coachman always flourishes highest
where there are thieves on the road, and where the guard travels
armed, and the stage is not only a link between country and city,
and the vehicle of news, but has a faint warfaring aroma, like a
man who should be brother to a soldier.&nbsp; California boasts
her famous stage-drivers, and among the famous Foss is not
forgotten.&nbsp; Along the unfenced, abominable mountain roads,
he launches his team with small regard to human life or the
doctrine of probabilities.&nbsp; Flinching travellers, who behold
themselves coasting eternity at every corner, look with natural
admiration at their driver&rsquo;s huge, impassive, fleshy
countenance.&nbsp; He has the very face for the driver in Sam
Weller&rsquo;s anecdote, who upset the election party at the
required point.&nbsp; Wonderful tales are current of his
readiness and skill.&nbsp; One in particular, of how one of his
horses fell at a ticklish passage of the road, and how Foss let
slip the reins, and, driving over the fallen animal, arrived at
the next stage with only three.&nbsp; This I relate as I heard
it, without guarantee.</p>
<p>I only saw Foss once, though, strange as it may sound, I have
twice talked with him.&nbsp; He lives out of Calistoga, at a
ranche called Fossville.&nbsp; One evening, after he was long
gone home, I dropped into Cheeseborough&rsquo;s, and was asked if
I should like to speak with Mr. Foss.&nbsp; Supposing that the
interview was impossible, and that I was merely called upon to
subscribe the general sentiment, I boldly answered
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next moment, I had one instrument at my
ear, another at my mouth and found myself, with nothing in the
world to say, conversing with a man several miles off among
desolate hills.&nbsp; Foss rapidly and somewhat plaintively
brought the conversation to an end; and he returned to his
night&rsquo;s grog at Fossville, while I strolled forth again on
Calistoga high street.&nbsp; But it was an odd thing that here,
on what we are accustomed to consider the very skirts of
civilization, I should have used the telephone for the first time
in my civilized career.&nbsp; So it goes in these young
countries; telephones, and telegraphs, and newspapers, and
advertisements running far ahead among the Indians and the
grizzly bears.</p>
<p>Alone, on the other side of the railway, stands the Springs
Hotel, with its attendant cottages.&nbsp; The floor of the valley
is extremely level to the very roots of the hills; only here and
there a hillock, crowned with pines, rises like the barrow of
some chieftain famed in war; and right against one of these
hillocks is the Springs Hotel&mdash;is or was; for since I was
there the place has been destroyed by fire, and has risen again
from its ashes.&nbsp; A lawn runs about the house, and the lawn
is in its turn surrounded by a system of little five-roomed
cottages, each with a verandah and a weedy palm before the
door.&nbsp; Some of the cottages are let to residents, and these
are wreathed in flowers.&nbsp; The rest are occupied by ordinary
visitors to the Hotel; and a very pleasant way this is, by which
you have a little country cottage of your own, without domestic
burthens, and by the day or week.</p>
<p>The whole neighbourhood of Mount Saint Helena is full of
sulphur and of boiling springs.&nbsp; The Geysers are famous;
they were the great health resort of the Indians before the
coming of the whites.&nbsp; Lake County is dotted with spas; Hot
Springs and White Sulphur Springs are the names of two stations
on the Napa Valley railroad; and Calistoga itself seems to repose
on a mere film above a boiling, subterranean lake.&nbsp; At one
end of the hotel enclosure are the springs from which it takes
its name, hot enough to scald a child seriously while I was
there.&nbsp; At the other end, the tenant of a cottage sank a
well, and there also the water came up boiling.&nbsp; It keeps
this end of the valley as warm as a toast.&nbsp; I have gone
across to the hotel a little after five in the morning, when a
sea fog from the Pacific was hanging thick and gray, and dark and
dirty overhead, and found the thermometer had been up before me,
and had already climbed among the nineties; and in the stress of
the day it was sometimes too hot to move about.</p>
<p>But in spite of this heat from above and below, doing one on
both sides, Calistoga was a pleasant place to dwell in;
beautifully green, for it was then that favoured moment in the
Californian year, when the rains are over and the dusty summer
has not yet set in; often visited by fresh airs, now from the
mountain, now across Sonoma from the sea; very quiet, very idle,
very silent but for the breezes and the cattle bells
afield.&nbsp; And there was something satisfactory in the sight
of that great mountain that enclosed us to the north: whether it
stood, robed in sunshine, quaking to its topmost pinnacle with
the heat and brightness of the day; or whether it set itself to
weaving vapours, wisp after wisp growing, trembling, fleeting,
and fading in the blue.</p>
<p>The tangled, woody, and almost trackless foot-hills that
enclose the valley, shutting it off from Sonoma on the west, and
from Yolo on the east&mdash;rough as they were in outline, dug
out by winter streams, crowned by cliffy bluffs and nodding pine
trees&mdash;wore dwarfed into satellites by the bulk and bearing
of Mount Saint Helena.&nbsp; She over-towered them by two-thirds
of her own stature.&nbsp; She excelled them by the boldness of
her profile.&nbsp; Her great bald summit, clear of trees and
pasture, a cairn of quartz and cinnabar, rejected kinship with
the dark and shaggy wilderness of lesser hill-tops.</p>
<h3><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE PETRIFIED FOREST</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> drove off from the Springs Hotel
about three in the afternoon.&nbsp; The sun warmed me to the
heart.&nbsp; A broad, cool wind streamed pauselessly down the
valley, laden with perfume.&nbsp; Up at the top stood Mount Saint
Helena, a bulk of mountain, bare atop, with tree-fringed spurs,
and radiating warmth.&nbsp; Once we saw it framed in a grove of
tall and exquisitely graceful white oaks, in line and colour a
finished composition.&nbsp; We passed a cow stretched by the
roadside, her bell slowly beating time to the movement of her
ruminating jaws, her big red face crawled over by half a dozen
flies, a monument of content.</p>
<p>A little farther, and we struck to the left up a mountain
road, and for two hours threaded one valley after another, green,
tangled, full of noble timber, giving us every now and again a
sight of Mount Saint Helena and the blue hilly distance, and
crossed by many streams, through which we splashed to the
carriage-step.&nbsp; To the right or the left, there was scarce
any trace of man but the road we followed; I think we passed but
one ranchero&rsquo;s house in the whole distance, and that was
closed and smokeless.&nbsp; But we had the society of these
bright streams&mdash;dazzlingly clear, as is their wont,
splashing from the wheels in diamonds, and striking a lively
coolness through the sunshine.&nbsp; And what with the
innumerable variety of greens, the masses of foliage tossing in
the breeze, the glimpses of distance, the descents into seemingly
impenetrable thickets, the continual dodging of the road which
made haste to plunge again into the covert, we had a fine sense
of woods, and spring-time, and the open air.</p>
<p>Our driver gave me a lecture by the way on Californian
trees&mdash;a thing I was much in need of, having fallen among
painters who know the name of nothing, and Mexicans who know the
name of nothing in English.&nbsp; He taught me the madrona, the
manzanita, the buck-eye, the maple; he showed me the crested
mountain quail; he showed me where some young redwoods were
already spiring heavenwards from the ruins of the old; for in
this district all had already perished: redwoods and redskins,
the two noblest indigenous living things, alike condemned.</p>
<p>At length, in a lonely dell, we came on a huge wooden gate
with a sign upon it like an inn.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Petrified
Forest.&nbsp; Proprietor: C. Evans,&rdquo; ran the legend.&nbsp;
Within, on a knoll of sward, was the house of the proprietor, and
another smaller house hard by to serve as a museum, where
photographs and petrifactions were retailed.&nbsp; It was a pure
little isle of touristry among these solitary hills.</p>
<p>The proprietor was a brave old white-faced Swede.&nbsp; He had
wandered this way, Heaven knows how, and taken up his
acres&mdash;I forget how many years ago&mdash;all alone, bent
double with sciatica, and with six bits in his pocket and an axe
upon his shoulder.&nbsp; Long, useless years of seafaring had
thus discharged him at the end, penniless and sick.&nbsp; Without
doubt he had tried his luck at the diggings, and got no good from
that; without doubt he had loved the bottle, and lived the life
of Jack ashore.&nbsp; But at the end of these adventures, here he
came; and, the place hitting his fancy, down he sat to make a new
life of it, far from crimps and the salt sea.&nbsp; And the very
sight of his ranche had done him good.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;the
handsomest spot in the Californy mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it handsome, now?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Every
penny he makes goes into that ranche to make it handsomer.&nbsp;
Then the climate, with the sea-breeze every afternoon in the
hottest summer weather, had gradually cured the sciatica; and his
sister and niece were now domesticated with him for
company&mdash;or, rather, the niece came only once in the two
days, teaching music the meanwhile in the valley.&nbsp; And then,
for a last piece of luck, &ldquo;the handsomest spot in the
Californy mountains&rdquo; had produced a petrified forest, which
Mr. Evans now shows at the modest figure of half a dollar a head,
or two-thirds of his capital when he first came there with an axe
and a sciatica.</p>
<p>This tardy favourite of fortune&mdash;hobbling a little, I
think, as if in memory of the sciatica, but with not a trace that
I can remember of the sea&mdash;thoroughly ruralized from head to
foot, proceeded to escort us up the hill behind his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who first found the forest?&rdquo; asked my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first?&nbsp; I was that man,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was cleaning up the pasture for my beasts, when I found
<i>this</i>&rdquo;&mdash;kicking a great redwood seven feet in
diameter, that lay there on its side, hollow heart, clinging
lumps of bark, all changed into gray stone, with veins of quartz
between what had been the layers of the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you surprised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; What would I be surprised
about?&nbsp; What did I know about petrifactions&mdash;following
the sea?&nbsp; Petrifaction!&nbsp; There was no such word in my
language!&nbsp; I knew about putrifaction, though!&nbsp; I
thought it was a stone; so would you, if you was cleaning up
pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now he had a theory of his own, which I did not quite
grasp, except that the trees had not &ldquo;grewed&rdquo;
there.&nbsp; But he mentioned, with evident pride, that he
differed from all the scientific people who had visited the spot;
and he flung about such words as &ldquo;tufa&rdquo; and
&ldquo;scilica&rdquo; with careless freedom.</p>
<p>When I mentioned I was from Scotland, &ldquo;My old
country,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my old country&rdquo;&mdash;with
a smiling look and a tone of real affection in his voice.&nbsp; I
was mightily surprised, for he was obviously Scandinavian, and
begged him to explain.&nbsp; It seemed he had learned his English
and done nearly all his sailing in Scotch ships.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out
of Glasgow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or Greenock; but that&rsquo;s
all the same&mdash;they all hail from Glasgow.&rdquo; And he was
so pleased with me for being a Scotsman, and his adopted
compatriot, that he made me a present of a very beautiful piece
of petrifaction&mdash;I believe the most beautiful and portable
he had.</p>
<p>Here was a man, at least, who was a Swede, a Scot, and an
American, acknowledging some kind allegiance to three
lands.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s Scoto-Circassian will not fail
to come before the reader.&nbsp; I have myself met and spoken
with a Fifeshire German, whose combination of abominable accents
struck me dumb.&nbsp; But, indeed, I think we all belong to many
countries.&nbsp; And perhaps this habit of much travel, and the
engendering of scattered friendships, may prepare the euthanasia
of ancient nations.</p>
<p>And the forest itself?&nbsp; Well, on a tangled, briery
hillside&mdash;for the pasture would bear a little further
cleaning up, to my eyes&mdash;there lie scattered thickly various
lengths of petrified trunk, such as the one already
mentioned.&nbsp; It is very curious, of course, and ancient
enough, if that were all.&nbsp; Doubtless, the heart of the
geologist beats quicker at the sight; but, for my part, I was
mightily unmoved.&nbsp; Sight-seeing is the art of
disappointment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing under heaven so
blue,<br />
That&rsquo;s fairly worth the travelling to.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, fortunately, Heaven rewards us with many agreeable
prospects and adventures by the way; and sometimes, when we go
out to see a petrified forest, prepares a far more delightful
curiosity, in the form of Mr. Evans, whom may all prosperity
attend throughout a long and green old age.</p>

34</span>CHAPTER III&mdash;NAPA WINE</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> interested in Californian
wine.&nbsp; Indeed, I am interested in all wines, and have been
all my life, from the raisin wine that a schoolfellow kept
secreted in his play-box up to my last discovery, those notable
Valtellines, that once shone upon the board of C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>Some of us, kind old Pagans, watch with dread the shadows
falling on the age: how the unconquerable worm invades the sunny
terraces of France, and Bordeaux is no more, and the Rhone a mere
Arabia Petr&aelig;a.&nbsp; Ch&acirc;teau Neuf is dead, and I have
never tasted it; Hermitage&mdash;a hermitage indeed from all
life&rsquo;s sorrows&mdash;lies expiring by the river.&nbsp; And
in the place of these imperial elixirs, beautiful to every sense,
gem-hued, flower-scented, dream-compellers:&mdash;behold upon the
quays at Cette the chemicals arrayed; behold the analyst at
Marseilles, raising hands in obsecration, attesting god Lyoeus,
and the vats staved in, and the dishonest wines poured forth
among the sea.&nbsp; It is not Pan only; Bacchus, too, is
dead.</p>
<p>If wine is to withdraw its most poetic countenance, the sun of
the white dinner-cloth, a deity to be invoked by two or three,
all fervent, hushing their talk, degusting tenderly, and storing
reminiscences&mdash;for a bottle of good wine, like a good act,
shines ever in the retrospect&mdash;if wine is to desert us, go
thy ways, old Jack!&nbsp; Now we begin to have compunctions, and
look back at the brave bottles squandered upon dinner-parties,
where the guests drank grossly, discussing politics the while,
and even the schoolboy &ldquo;took his whack,&rdquo; like
liquorice water.&nbsp; And at the same time, we look timidly
forward, with a spark of hope, to where the new lands, already
weary of producing gold, begin to green with vineyards.&nbsp; A
nice point in human history falls to be decided by Californian
and Australian wines.</p>
<p>Wine in California is still in the experimental stage; and
when you taste a vintage, grave economical questions are
involved.&nbsp; The beginning of vine-planting is like the
beginning of mining for the precious metals: the wine-grower also
&ldquo;Prospects.&rdquo; One corner of land after another is
tried with one kind of grape after another.&nbsp; This is a
failure; that is better; a third best.&nbsp; So, bit by bit, they
grope about for their Clos Vougeot and Lafite.&nbsp; Those lodes
and pockets of earth, more precious than the precious ores, that
yield inimitable fragrance and soft fire; those virtuous
Bonanzas, where the soil has sublimated under sun and stars to
something finer, and the wine is bottled poetry: these still lie
undiscovered; chaparral conceals, thicket embowers them; the
miner chips the rock and wanders farther, and the grizzly muses
undisturbed.&nbsp; But there they bide their hour, awaiting their
Columbus; and nature nurses and prepares them.&nbsp; The smack of
Californian earth shall linger on the palate of your
grandson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wine is merely a good wine; the best that I have
tasted better than a Beaujolais, and not unlike.&nbsp; But the
trade is poor; it lives from hand to mouth, putting its all into
experiments, and forced to sell its vintages.&nbsp; To find one
properly matured, and bearing its own name, is to be
fortune&rsquo;s favourite.</p>
<p>Bearing its own name, I say, and dwell upon the innuendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know why California wine is not drunk in
the States?&rdquo; a San Francisco wine merchant said to me,
after he had shown me through his premises.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
here&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And opening a large cupboard, fitted with many little drawers,
he proceeded to shower me all over with a great variety of
gorgeously tinted labels, blue, red, or yellow, stamped with
crown or coronet, and hailing from such a profusion of
<i>clos</i> and <i>chateaux</i>, that a single department could
scarce have furnished forth the names.&nbsp; But it was strange
that all looked unfamiliar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chateau X&mdash;?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
heard of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had been
reading one of X&mdash;&rsquo;s novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all castles in Spain!&nbsp; But that sure enough is
the reason why California wine is not drunk in the States.</p>
<p>Napa valley has been long a seat of the wine-growing
industry.&nbsp; It did not here begin, as it does too often, in
the low valley lands along the river, but took at once to the
rough foot-hills, where alone it can expect to prosper.&nbsp; A
basking inclination, and stones, to be a reservoir of the
day&rsquo;s heat, seem necessary to the soil for wine; the
grossness of the earth must be evaporated, its marrow daily
melted and refined for ages; until at length these clods that
break below our footing, and to the eye appear but common earth,
are truly and to the perceiving mind, a masterpiece of
nature.&nbsp; The dust of Richebourg, which the wind carries
away, what an apotheosis of the dust!&nbsp; Not man himself can
seem a stranger child of that brown, friable powder, than the
blood and sun in that old flask behind the faggots.</p>
<p>A Californian vineyard, one of man&rsquo;s outposts in the
wilderness, has features of its own.&nbsp; There is nothing here
to remind you of the Rhine or Rhone, of the low <i>c&ocirc;te
d&rsquo;or</i>, or the infamous and scabby deserts of Champagne;
but all is green, solitary, covert.&nbsp; We visited two of them,
Mr. Schram&rsquo;s and Mr. M&rsquo;Eckron&rsquo;s, sharing the
same glen.</p>
<p>Some way down the valley below Calistoga, we turned sharply to
the south and plunged into the thick of the wood.&nbsp; A rude
trail rapidly mounting; a little stream tinkling by on the one
hand, big enough perhaps after the rains, but already yielding up
its life; overhead and on all sides a bower of green and tangled
thicket, still fragrant and still flower-bespangled by the early
season, where thimble-berry played the part of our English
hawthorn, and the buck-eyes were putting forth their twisted
horns of blossom: through all this, we struggled toughly upwards,
canted to and fro by the roughness of the trail, and continually
switched across the face by sprays of leaf or blossom.&nbsp; The
last is no great inconvenience at home; but here in California it
is a matter of some moment.&nbsp; For in all woods and by every
wayside there prospers an abominable shrub or weed, called
poison-oak, whose very neighbourhood is venomous to some, and
whose actual touch is avoided by the most impervious.</p>
<p>The two houses, with their vineyards, stood each in a green
niche of its own in this steep and narrow forest dell.&nbsp;
Though they were so near, there was already a good difference in
level; and Mr. M&rsquo;Eckron&rsquo;s head must be a long way
under the feet of Mr. Schram.&nbsp; No more had been cleared than
was necessary for cultivation; close around each oasis ran the
tangled wood; the glen enfolds them; there they lie basking in
sun and silence, concealed from all but the clouds and the
mountain birds.</p>
<p>Mr. M&rsquo;Eckron&rsquo;s is a bachelor establishment; a
little bit of a wooden house, a small cellar hard by in the
hillside, and a patch of vines planted and tended single-handed
by himself.&nbsp; He had but recently began; his vines were
young, his business young also; but I thought he had the look of
the man who succeeds.&nbsp; He hailed from Greenock: he
remembered his father putting him inside Mons Meg, and that
touched me home; and we exchanged a word or two of Scotch, which
pleased me more than you would fancy.</p>
<p>Mr. Schram&rsquo;s, on the other hand, is the oldest vineyard
in the valley, eighteen years old, I think; yet he began a
penniless barber, and even after he had broken ground up here
with his black malvoisies, continued for long to tramp the valley
with his razor.&nbsp; Now, his place is the picture of
prosperity: stuffed birds in the verandah, cellars far dug into
the hillside, and resting on pillars like a bandit&rsquo;s
cave:&mdash;all trimness, varnish, flowers, and sunshine, among
the tangled wildwood.&nbsp; Stout, smiling Mrs. Schram, who has
been to Europe and apparently all about the States for pleasure,
entertained Fanny in the verandah, while I was tasting wines in
the cellar.&nbsp; To Mr. Schram this was a solemn office; his
serious gusto warmed my heart; prosperity had not yet wholly
banished a certain neophite and girlish trepidation, and he
followed every sip and read my face with proud anxiety.&nbsp; I
tasted all.&nbsp; I tasted every variety and shade of
Schramberger, red and white Schramberger, Burgundy Schramberger,
Schramberger Hock, Schramberger Golden Chasselas, the latter with
a notable bouquet, and I fear to think how many more.&nbsp; Much
of it goes to London&mdash;most, I think; and Mr. Schram has a
great notion of the English taste.</p>
<p>In this wild spot, I did not feel the sacredness of ancient
cultivation.&nbsp; It was still raw, it was no Marathon, and no
Johannisberg; yet the stirring sunlight, and the growing vines,
and the vats and bottles in the cavern, made a pleasant music for
the mind.&nbsp; Here, also, earth&rsquo;s cream was being skimmed
and garnered; and the London customers can taste, such as it is,
the tang of the earth in this green valley.&nbsp; So local, so
quintessential is a wine, that it seems the very birds in the
verandah might communicate a flavour, and that romantic cellar
influence the bottle next to be uncorked in Pimlico, and the
smile of jolly Mr. Schram might mantle in the glass.</p>
<p>But these are but experiments.&nbsp; All things in this new
land are moving farther on: the wine-vats and the miner&rsquo;s
blasting tools but picket for a night, like Bedouin pavillions;
and to-morrow, to fresh woods!&nbsp; This stir of change and
these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall, haunt the
land.&nbsp; Men move eternally, still chasing Fortune; and,
fortune found, still wander.&nbsp; As we drove back to Calistoga,
the road lay empty of mere passengers, but its green side was
dotted with the camps of travelling families: one cumbered with a
great waggonful of household stuff, settlers going to occupy a
ranche they had taken up in Mendocino, or perhaps Tehama County;
another, a party in dust coats, men and women, whom we found
camped in a grove on the roadside, all on pleasure bent, with a
Chinaman to cook for them, and who waved their hands to us as we
drove by.</p>
<h3><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE SCOT ABROAD</h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">few</span> pages back, I wrote that a
man belonged, in these days, to a variety of countries; but the
old land is still the true love, the others are but pleasant
infidelities.&nbsp; Scotland is indefinable; it has no unity
except upon the map.&nbsp; Two languages, many dialects,
innumerable forms of piety, and countless local patriotisms and
prejudices, part us among ourselves more widely than the extreme
east and west of that great continent of America.&nbsp; When I am
at home, I feel a man from Glasgow to be something like a rival,
a man from Barra to be more than half a foreigner.&nbsp; Yet let
us meet in some far country, and, whether we hail from the braes
of Manor or the braes of Mar, some ready-made affection joins us
on the instant.&nbsp; It is not race.&nbsp; Look at us.&nbsp; One
is Norse, one Celtic, and another Saxon.&nbsp; It is not
community of tongue.&nbsp; We have it not among ourselves; and we
have it almost to perfection, with English, or Irish, or
American.&nbsp; It is no tie of faith, for we detest each
other&rsquo;s errors.&nbsp; And yet somewhere, deep down in the
heart of each one of us, something yearns for the old land, and
the old kindly people.</p>
<p>Of all mysteries of the human heart, this is perhaps the most
inscrutable.&nbsp; There is no special loveliness in that gray
country, with its rainy, sea-beat archipelago; its fields of dark
mountains; its unsightly places, black with coal; its treeless,
sour, unfriendly looking corn-lands; its quaint, gray, castled
city, where the bells clash of a Sunday, and the wind squalls,
and the salt showers fly and beat.&nbsp; I do not even know if I
desire to live there; but let me hear, in some far land, a
kindred voice sing out, &ldquo;Oh, why left I my hame?&rdquo; and
it seems at once as if no beauty under the kind heavens, and no
society of the wise and good, can repay me for my absence from my
country.&nbsp; And though I think I would rather die elsewhere,
yet in my heart of hearts I long to be buried among good Scots
clods.&nbsp; I will say it fairly, it grows on me with every
year: there are no stars so lovely as Edinburgh
street-lamps.&nbsp; When I forget thee, auld Reekie, may my right
hand forget its cunning!</p>
<p>The happiest lot on earth is to be born a Scotchman.&nbsp; You
must pay for it in many ways, as for all other advantages on
earth.&nbsp; You have to learn the paraphrases and the shorter
catechism; you generally take to drink; your youth, as far as I
can find out, is a time of louder war against society, of more
outcry and tears and turmoil, than if you had been born, for
instance, in England.&nbsp; But somehow life is warmer and
closer; the hearth burns more redly; the lights of home shine
softer on the rainy street; the very names, endeared in verse and
music, cling nearer round our hearts.&nbsp; An Englishman may
meet an Englishman to-morrow, upon Chimborazo, and neither of
them care; but when the Scotch wine-grower told me of Mons Meg,
it was like magic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From the dim shieling on the misty
island<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains divide us, and a world of seas;<br />
Yet still our hearts are true, our hearts are Highland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we, in dreams, behold the Hebrides.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, Highland and Lowland, all our hearts are Scotch.</p>
<p>Only a few days after I had seen M&rsquo;Eckron, a message
reached me in my cottage.&nbsp; It was a Scotchman who had come
down a long way from the hills to market.&nbsp; He had heard
there was a countryman in Calistoga, and came round to the hotel
to see him.&nbsp; We said a few words to each other; we had not
much to say&mdash;should never have seen each other had we stayed
at home, separated alike in space and in society; and then we
shook hands, and he went his way again to his ranche among the
hills, and that was all.</p>
<p>Another Scotchman there was, a resident, who for the more love
of the common country, douce, serious, religious man, drove me
all about the valley, and took as much interest in me as if I had
been his son: more, perhaps; for the son has faults too keenly
felt, while the abstract countryman is perfect&mdash;like a whiff
of peats.</p>
<p>And there was yet another.&nbsp; Upon him I came suddenly, as
he was calmly entering my cottage, his mind quite evidently bent
on plunder: a man of about fifty, filthy, ragged, roguish, with a
chimney-pot hat and a tail coat, and a pursing of his mouth that
might have been envied by an elder of the kirk.&nbsp; He had just
such a face as I have seen a dozen times behind the plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, sir!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned round without a quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Scotchman, sir?&rdquo; he said
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;So am I; I come from Aberdeen.&nbsp; This
is my card,&rdquo; presenting me with a piece of pasteboard which
he had raked out of some gutter in the period of the rains.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was just examining this palm,&rdquo; he continued,
indicating the misbegotten plant before our door, &ldquo;which is
the largest sp<i>a</i>cimen I have yet observed in
Califoarnia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were four or five larger within sight.&nbsp; But where
was the use of argument?&nbsp; He produced a tape-line, made me
help him to measure the tree at the level of the ground, and
entered the figures in a large and filthy pocket-book, all with
the gravity of Solomon.&nbsp; He then thanked me profusely,
remarking that such little services were due between countrymen;
shook hands with me, &ldquo;for add lang syne,&rdquo; as he said;
and took himself solemnly away, radiating dirt and humbug as he
went.</p>
<p>A month or two after this encounter of mine, there came a Scot
to Sacramento&mdash;perhaps from Aberdeen.&nbsp; Anyway, there
never was any one more Scotch in this wide world.&nbsp; He could
sing and dance, and drink, I presume; and he played the pipes
with vigour and success.&nbsp; All the Scotch in Sacramento
became infatuated with him, and spent their spare time and money,
driving him about in an open cab, between drinks, while he blew
himself scarlet at the pipes.&nbsp; This is a very sad
story.&nbsp; After he had borrowed money from every one, he and
his pipes suddenly disappeared from Sacramento, and when I last
heard, the police were looking for him.</p>
<p>I cannot say how this story amused me, when I felt myself so
thoroughly ripe on both sides to be duped in the same way.</p>
<p>It is at least a curious thing, to conclude, that the races
which wander widest, Jews and Scotch, should be the most clannish
in the world.&nbsp; But perhaps these two are cause and effect:
&ldquo;For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>PART II&mdash;WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<h3><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER I.&mdash;TO INTRODUCE MR. KELMAR</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> thing in this new country very
particularly strikes a stranger, and that is the number of
antiquities.&nbsp; Already there have been many cycles of
population succeeding each other, and passing away and leaving
behind them relics.&nbsp; These, standing on into changed times,
strike the imagination as forcibly as any pyramid or feudal
tower.&nbsp; The towns, like the vineyards, are experimentally
founded: they grow great and prosper by passing occasions; and
when the lode comes to an end, and the miners move elsewhere, the
town remains behind them, like Palmyra in the desert.&nbsp; I
suppose there are, in no country in the world, so many deserted
towns as here in California.</p>
<p>The whole neighbourhood of Mount Saint Helena, now so quiet
and sylvan, was once alive with mining camps and villages.&nbsp;
Here there would be two thousand souls under canvas; there one
thousand or fifteen hundred ensconced, as if for ever, in a town
of comfortable houses.&nbsp; But the luck had failed, the mines
petered out; and the army of miners had departed, and left this
quarter of the world to the rattlesnakes and deer and grizzlies,
and to the slower but steadier advance of husbandry.</p>
<p>It was with an eye on one of these deserted places, Pine Flat,
on the Geysers road, that we had come first to Calistoga.&nbsp;
There is something singularly enticing in the idea of going,
rent-free, into a ready-made house.&nbsp; And to the British
merchant, sitting at home at ease, it may appear that, with such
a roof over your head and a spring of clear water hard by, the
whole problem of the squatter&rsquo;s existence would be
solved.&nbsp; Food, however, has yet to be considered, I will go
as far as most people on tinned meats; some of the brightest
moments of my life were passed over tinned mulli-gatawney in the
cabin of a sixteen-ton schooner, storm-stayed in Portree Bay; but
after suitable experiments, I pronounce authoritatively that man
cannot live by tins alone.&nbsp; Fresh meat must be had on an
occasion.&nbsp; It is true that the great Foss, driving by along
the Geysers road, wooden-faced, but glorified with legend, might
have been induced to bring us meat, but the great Foss could
hardly bring us milk.&nbsp; To take a cow would have involved
taking a field of grass and a milkmaid; after which it would have
been hardly worth while to pause, and we might have added to our
colony a flock of sheep and an experienced butcher.</p>
<p>It is really very disheartening how we depend on other people
in this life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mihi est propositum,&rdquo; as you may
see by the motto, &ldquo;id quod regibus;&rdquo; and behold it
cannot be carried out, unless I find a neighbour rolling in
cattle.</p>
<p>Now, my principal adviser in this matter was one whom I will
call Kelmar.&nbsp; That was not what he called himself, but as
soon as I set eyes on him, I knew it was or ought to be his name;
I am sure it will be his name among the angels.&nbsp; Kelmar was
the store-keeper, a Russian Jew, good-natured, in a very thriving
way of business, and, on equal terms, one of the most serviceable
of men.&nbsp; He also had something of the expression of a Scotch
country elder, who, by some peculiarity, should chance to be a
Hebrew.&nbsp; He had a projecting under lip, with which he
continually smiled, or rather smirked.&nbsp; Mrs. Kelmar was a
singularly kind woman; and the oldest son had quite a dark and
romantic bearing, and might be heard on summer evenings playing
sentimental airs on the violin.</p>
<p>I had no idea, at the time I made his acquaintance, what an
important person Kelmar was.&nbsp; But the Jew store-keepers of
California, profiting at once by the needs and habits of the
people, have made themselves in too many cases the tyrants of the
rural population.&nbsp; Credit is offered, is pressed on the new
customer, and when once he is beyond his depth, the tune changes,
and he is from thenceforth a white slave.&nbsp; I believe, even
from the little I saw, that Kelmar, if he choose to put on the
screw, could send half the settlers packing in a radius of seven
or eight miles round Calistoga.&nbsp; These are continually
paying him, but are never suffered to get out of debt.&nbsp; He
palms dull goods upon them, for they dare not refuse to buy; he
goes and dines with them when he is on an outing, and no man is
loudlier welcomed; he is their family friend, the director of
their business, and, to a degree elsewhere unknown in modern
days, their king.</p>
<p>For some reason, Kelmar always shook his head at the mention
of Pine Flat, and for some days I thought he disapproved of the
whole scheme and was proportionately sad.&nbsp; One fine morning,
however, he met me, wreathed in smiles.&nbsp; He had found the
very place for me&mdash;Silverado, another old mining town, right
up the mountain.&nbsp; Rufe Hanson, the hunter, could take care
of us&mdash;fine people the Hansons; we should be close to the
Toll House, where the Lakeport stage called daily; it was the
best place for my health, besides.&nbsp; Rufe had been
consumptive, and was now quite a strong man, ain&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; In short, the place and all its accompaniments seemed
made for us on purpose.</p>
<p>He took me to his back door, whence, as from every point of
Calistoga, Mount Saint Helena could be seen towering in the
air.&nbsp; There, in the nick, just where the eastern foothills
joined the mountain, and she herself began to rise above the zone
of forest&mdash;there was Silverado.&nbsp; The name had already
pleased me; the high station pleased me still more.&nbsp; I began
to inquire with some eagerness.&nbsp; It was but a little while
ago that Silverado was a great place.&nbsp; The mine&mdash;a
silver mine, of course&mdash;had promised great things.&nbsp;
There was quite a lively population, with several hotels and
boarding-houses; and Kelmar himself had opened a branch store,
and done extremely well&mdash;&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
said, appealing to his wife.&nbsp; And she said, &ldquo;Yes;
extremely well.&rdquo; Now there was no one living in the town
but Rufe the hunter; and once more I heard Rufe&rsquo;s praises
by the yard, and this time sung in chorus.</p>
<p>I could not help perceiving at the time that there was
something underneath; that no unmixed desire to have us
comfortably settled had inspired the Kelmars with this flow of
words.&nbsp; But I was impatient to be gone, to be about my
kingly project; and when we were offered seats in Kelmar&rsquo;s
waggon, I accepted on the spot.&nbsp; The plan of their next
Sunday&rsquo;s outing took them, by good fortune, over the border
into Lake County.&nbsp; They would carry us so far, drop us at
the Toll House, present us to the Hansons, and call for us again
on Monday morning early.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF SILVERADO</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were to leave by six precisely;
that was solemnly pledged on both sides; and a messenger came to
us the last thing at night, to remind us of the hour.&nbsp; But
it was eight before we got clear of Calistoga: Kelmar, Mrs.
Kelmar, a friend of theirs whom we named Abramina, her little
daughter, my wife, myself, and, stowed away behind us, a cluster
of ship&rsquo;s coffee-kettles.&nbsp; These last were highly
ornamental in the sheen of their bright tin, but I could invent
no reason for their presence.&nbsp; Our carriageful reckoned up,
as near as we could get at it, some three hundred years to the
six of us.&nbsp; Four of the six, besides, were Hebrews.&nbsp;
But I never, in all my life, was conscious of so strong an
atmosphere of holiday.&nbsp; No word was spoken but of pleasure;
and even when we drove in silence, nods and smiles went round the
party like refreshments.</p>
<p>The sun shone out of a cloudless sky.&nbsp; Close at the
zenith rode the belated moon, still clearly visible, and, along
one margin, even bright.&nbsp; The wind blew a gale from the
north; the trees roared; the corn and the deep grass in the
valley fled in whitening surges; the dust towered into the air
along the road and dispersed like the smoke of battle.&nbsp; It
was clear in our teeth from the first, and for all the windings
of the road it managed to keep clear in our teeth until the
end.</p>
<p>For some two miles we rattled through the valley, skirting the
eastern foothills; then we struck off to the right, through
haugh-land, and presently, crossing a dry water-course, entered
the Toll road, or, to be more local, entered on &ldquo;the
grade.&rdquo;&nbsp; The road mounts the near shoulder of Mount
Saint Helena, bound northward into Lake County.&nbsp; In one
place it skirts along the edge of a narrow and deep canyon,
filled with trees, and I was glad, indeed, not to be driven at
this point by the dashing Foss.&nbsp; Kelmar, with his unvarying
smile, jogging to the motion of the trap, drove for all the world
like a good, plain, country clergyman at home; and I profess I
blessed him unawares for his timidity.</p>
<p>Vineyards and deep meadows, islanded and framed with thicket,
gave place more and more as we ascended to woods of oak and
madrona, dotted with enormous pines.&nbsp; It was these pines, as
they shot above the lower wood, that produced that pencilling of
single trees I had so often remarked from the valley.&nbsp;
Thence, looking up and from however far, each fir stands separate
against the sky no bigger than an eyelash; and all together lend
a quaint, fringed aspect to the hills.&nbsp; The oak is no baby;
even the madrona, upon these spurs of Mount Saint Helena, comes
to a fine bulk and ranks with forest trees&mdash;but the pines
look down upon the rest for underwood.&nbsp; As Mount Saint
Helena among her foothills, so these dark giants out-top their
fellow-vegetables.&nbsp; Alas! if they had left the redwoods, the
pines, in turn, would have been dwarfed.&nbsp; But the redwoods,
fallen from their high estate, are serving as family bedsteads,
or yet more humbly as field fences, along all Napa Valley.</p>
<p>A rough smack of resin was in the air, and a crystal mountain
purity.&nbsp; It came pouring over these green slopes by the
oceanful.&nbsp; The woods sang aloud, and gave largely of their
healthful breath.&nbsp; Gladness seemed to inhabit these upper
zones, and we had left indifference behind us in the
valley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I to the hills lift mine eyes!&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are days in a life when thus to climb out of the lowlands,
seems like scaling heaven.</p>
<p>As we continued to ascend, the wind fell upon us with
increasing strength.&nbsp; It was a wonder how the two stout
horses managed to pull us up that steep incline and still face
the athletic opposition of the wind, or how their great eyes were
able to endure the dust.&nbsp; Ten minutes after we went by, a
tree fell, blocking the road; and even before us leaves were
thickly strewn, and boughs had fallen, large enough to make the
passage difficult.&nbsp; But now we were hard by the
summit.&nbsp; The road crosses the ridge, just in the nick that
Kelmar showed me from below, and then, without pause, plunges
down a deep, thickly wooded glen on the farther side.&nbsp; At
the highest point a trail strikes up the main hill to the
leftward; and that leads to Silverado.&nbsp; A hundred yards
beyond, and in a kind of elbow of the glen, stands the Toll House
Hotel.&nbsp; We came up the one side, were caught upon the summit
by the whole weight of the wind as it poured over into Napa
Valley, and a minute after had drawn up in shelter, but all
buffetted and breathless, at the Toll House door.</p>
<p>A water-tank, and stables, and a gray house of two stories,
with gable ends and a verandah, are jammed hard against the
hillside, just where a stream has cut for itself a narrow canyon,
filled with pines.&nbsp; The pines go right up overhead; a little
more and the stream might have played, like a fire-hose, on the
Toll House roof.&nbsp; In front the ground drops as sharply as it
rises behind.&nbsp; There is just room for the road and a sort of
promontory of croquet ground, and then you can lean over the edge
and look deep below you through the wood.&nbsp; I said croquet
<i>ground</i>, not <i>green</i>; for the surface was of brown,
beaten earth.&nbsp; The toll-bar itself was the only other note
of originality: a long beam, turning on a post, and kept slightly
horizontal by a counterweight of stones.&nbsp; Regularly about
sundown this rude barrier was swung, like a derrick, across the
road and made fast, I think, to a tree upon the farther side.</p>
<p>On our arrival there followed a gay scene in the bar.&nbsp; I
was presented to Mr. Corwin, the landlord; to Mr. Jennings, the
engineer, who lives there for his health; to Mr. Hoddy, a most
pleasant little gentleman, once a member of the Ohio legislature,
again the editor of a local paper, and now, with undiminished
dignity, keeping the Toll House bar.&nbsp; I had a number of
drinks and cigars bestowed on me, and enjoyed a famous
opportunity of seeing Kelmar in his glory, friendly, radiant,
smiling, steadily edging one of the ship&rsquo;s kettles on the
reluctant Corwin.</p>
<p>Corwin, plainly aghast, resisted gallantly, and for that bout
victory crowned his arms.</p>
<p>At last we set forth for Silverado on foot.&nbsp; Kelmar and
his jolly Jew girls were full of the sentiment of Sunday outings,
breathed geniality and vagueness, and suffered a little vile boy
from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods.&nbsp;
For three people all so old, so bulky in body, and belonging to a
race so venerable, they could not but surprise us by their
extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit.&nbsp; They
were only going to stay ten minutes at the Toll House; had they
not twenty long miles of road before them on the other
side?&nbsp; Stay to dinner?&nbsp; Not they!&nbsp; Put up the
horses? Never.&nbsp; Let us attach them to the verandah by a wisp
of straw rope, such as would not have held a person&rsquo;s hat
on that blustering day.&nbsp; And with all these protestations of
hurry, they proved irresponsible like children.&nbsp; Kelmar
himself, shrewd old Russian Jew, with a smirk that seemed just to
have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction, intrusted himself
and us devoutly to that boy.&nbsp; Yet the boy was patently
fallacious; and for that matter a most unsympathetic urchin,
raised apparently on gingerbread.&nbsp; He was bent on his own
pleasure, nothing else; and Kelmar followed him to his ruin, with
the same shrewd smirk.&nbsp; If the boy said there was &ldquo;a
hole there in the hill&rdquo;&mdash;a hole, pure and simple,
neither more nor less&mdash;Kelmar and his Jew girls would follow
him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole.&nbsp;
For two hours we looked for houses; and for two hours they
followed us, smelling trees, picking flowers, foisting false
botany on the unwary.&nbsp; Had we taken five, with that vile lad
to head them off on idle divagations, for five they would have
smiled and stumbled through the woods.</p>
<p>However, we came forth at length, and as by accident, upon a
lawn, sparse planted like an orchard, but with forest instead of
fruit trees.&nbsp; That was the site of Silverado mining
town.&nbsp; A piece of ground was levelled up, where
Kelmar&rsquo;s store had been; and facing that we saw Rufe
Hanson&rsquo;s house, still bearing on its front the legend
<i>Silverado Hotel</i>.&nbsp; Not another sign of
habitation.&nbsp; Silverado town had all been carted from the
scene; one of the houses was now the school-house far down the
road; one was gone here, one there, but all were gone away.</p>
<p>It was now a sylvan solitude, and the silence was unbroken but
by the great, vague voice of the wind.&nbsp; Some days before our
visit, a grizzly bear had been sporting round the Hansons&rsquo;
chicken-house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hanson was at home alone, we found.&nbsp; Rufe had been
out after a &ldquo;bar,&rdquo; had risen late, and was now gone,
it did not clearly appear whither.&nbsp; Perhaps he had had wind
of Kelmar&rsquo;s coming, and was now ensconced among the
underwood, or watching us from the shoulder of the
mountain.&nbsp; We, hearing there were no houses to be had, were
for immediately giving up all hopes of Silverado.&nbsp; But this,
somehow, was not to Kelmar&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; He first proposed
that we should &ldquo;camp someveres around, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; waving his hand cheerily as though to weave a spell;
and when that was firmly rejected, he decided that we must take
up house with the Hansons.&nbsp; Mrs. Hanson had been, from the
first, flustered, subdued, and a little pale; but from this
proposition she recoiled with haggard indignation.&nbsp; So did
we, who would have preferred, in a manner of speaking,
death.&nbsp; But Kelmar was not to be put by.&nbsp; He edged Mrs.
Hanson into a corner, where for a long time he threatened her
with his forefinger, like a character in Dickens; and the poor
woman, driven to her entrenchments, at last remembered with a
shriek that there were still some houses at the tunnel.</p>
<p>Thither we went; the Jews, who should already have been miles
into Lake County, still cheerily accompanying us.&nbsp; For about
a furlong we followed a good road alone, the hillside through the
forest, until suddenly that road widened out and came abruptly to
an end.&nbsp; A canyon, woody below, red, rocky, and naked
overhead, was here walled across by a dump of rolling stones,
dangerously steep, and from twenty to thirty feet in
height.&nbsp; A rusty iron chute on wooden legs came flying, like
a monstrous gargoyle, across the parapet.&nbsp; It was down this
that they poured the precious ore; and below here the carts stood
to wait their lading, and carry it mill-ward down the
mountain.</p>
<p>The whole canyon was so entirely blocked, as if by some rude
guerilla fortification, that we could only mount by lengths of
wooden ladder, fixed in the hillside.&nbsp; These led us round
the farther corner of the dump; and when they were at an end, we
still persevered over loose rubble and wading deep in poison oak,
till we struck a triangular platform, filling up the whole glen,
and shut in on either hand by bold projections of the
mountain.&nbsp; Only in front the place was open like the
proscenium of a theatre, and we looked forth into a great realm
of air, and down upon treetops and hilltops, and far and near on
wild and varied country.&nbsp; The place still stood as on the
day it was deserted: a line of iron rails with a bifurcation; a
truck in working order; a world of lumber, old wood, old iron; a
blacksmith&rsquo;s forge on one side, half buried in the leaves
of dwarf madronas; and on the other, an old brown wooden
house.</p>
<p>Fanny and I dashed at the house.&nbsp; It consisted of three
rooms, and was so plastered against the hill, that one room was
right atop of another, that the upper floor was more than twice
as large as the lower, and that all three apartments must be
entered from a different side and level.&nbsp; Not a window-sash
remained.</p>
<p>The door of the lower room was smashed, and one panel hung in
splinters.&nbsp; We entered that, and found a fair amount of
rubbish: sand and gravel that had been sifted in there by the
mountain winds; straw, sticks, and stones; a table, a barrel; a
plate-rack on the wall; two home-made bootjacks, signs of miners
and their boots; and a pair of papers pinned on the boarding,
headed respectively &ldquo;Funnel No. 1,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Funnel
No. 2,&rdquo; but with the tails torn away.&nbsp; The window,
sashless of course, was choked with the green and sweetly
smelling foliage of a bay; and through a chink in the floor, a
spray of poison oak had shot up and was handsomely prospering in
the interior.&nbsp; It was my first care to cut away that poison
oak, Fanny standing by at a respectful distance.&nbsp; That was
our first improvement by which we took possession.</p>
<p>The room immediately above could only be entered by a plank
propped against the threshold, along which the intruder must foot
it gingerly, clutching for support to sprays of poison oak, the
proper product of the country.&nbsp; Herein was, on either hand,
a triple tier of beds, where miners had once lain; and the other
gable was pierced by a sashless window and a doorless doorway
opening on the air of heaven, five feet above the ground.&nbsp;
As for the third room, which entered squarely from the ground
level, but higher up the hill and farther up the canyon, it
contained only rubbish and the uprights for another triple tier
of beds.</p>
<p>The whole building was overhung by a bold, lion-like, red
rock. Poison oak, sweet bay trees, calcanthus, brush, and
chaparral, grew freely but sparsely all about it. In front, in
the strong sunshine, the platform lay overstrewn with busy
litter, as though the labours of the mine might begin again
to-morrow in the morning.</p>
<p>Following back into the canyon, among the mass of rotting
plant and through the flowering bushes, we came to a great crazy
staging, with a wry windless on the top; and clambering up, we
could look into an open shaft, leading edgeways down into the
bowels of the mountain, trickling with water, and lit by some
stray sun-gleams, whence I know not.&nbsp; In that quiet place
the still, far-away tinkle of the water-drops was loudly
audible.&nbsp; Close by, another shaft led edgeways up into the
superincumbent shoulder of the hill.&nbsp; It lay partly open;
and sixty or a hundred feet above our head, we could see the
strata propped apart by solid wooden wedges, and a pine, half
undermined, precariously nodding on the verge.&nbsp; Here also a
rugged, horizontal tunnel ran straight into the unsunned bowels
of the rock.&nbsp; This secure angle in the mountain&rsquo;s
flank was, even on this wild day, as still as my lady&rsquo;s
chamber.&nbsp; But in the tunnel a cold, wet draught
tempestuously blew.&nbsp; Nor have I ever known that place
otherwise than cold and windy.</p>
<p>Such was our fist prospect of Juan Silverado.&nbsp; I own I
had looked for something different: a clique of neighbourly
houses on a village green, we shall say, all empty to be sure,
but swept and varnished; a trout stream brawling by; great elms
or chestnuts, humming with bees and nested in by song-birds; and
the mountains standing round about, as at Jerusalem.&nbsp; Here,
mountain and house and the old tools of industry were all alike
rusty and downfalling.&nbsp; The hill was here wedged up, and
there poured forth its bowels in a spout of broken mineral; man
with his picks and powder, and nature with her own great blasting
tools of sun and rain, labouring together at the ruin of that
proud mountain.&nbsp; The view up the canyon was a glimpse of
devastation; dry red minerals sliding together, here and there a
crag, here and there dwarf thicket clinging in the general
glissade, and over all a broken outline trenching on the blue of
heaven.&nbsp; Downwards indeed, from our rock eyrie, we behold
the greener side of nature; and the bearing of the pines and the
sweet smell of bays and nutmegs commanded themselves gratefully
to our senses.&nbsp; One way and another, now the die was
cast.&nbsp; Silverado be it!</p>
<p>After we had got back to the Toll House, the Jews were not
long of striking forward.&nbsp; But I observed that one of the
Hanson lads came down, before their departure, and returned with
a ship&rsquo;s kettle.&nbsp; Happy Hansons!&nbsp; Nor was it
until after Kelmar was gone, if I remember rightly, that Rufe put
in an appearance to arrange the details of our installation.</p>
<p>The latter part of the day, Fanny and I sat in the verandah of
the Toll House, utterly stunned by the uproar of the wind among
the trees on the other side of the valley.&nbsp; Sometimes, we
would have it it was like a sea, but it was not various enough
for that; and again, we thought it like the roar of a cataract,
but it was too changeful for the cataract; and then we would
decide, speaking in sleepy voices, that it could be compared with
nothing but itself.&nbsp; My mind was entirely preoccupied by the
noise.&nbsp; I hearkened to it by the hour, gapingly hearkened,
and let my cigarette go out.&nbsp; Sometimes the wind would make
a sally nearer hand, and send a shrill, whistling crash among the
foliage on our side of the glen; and sometimes a back-draught
would strike into the elbow where we sat, and cast the gravel and
torn leaves into our faces.&nbsp; But for the most part, this
great, streaming gale passed unweariedly by us into Napa Valley,
not two hundred yards away, visible by the tossing boughs,
stunningly audible, and yet not moving a hair upon our
heads.&nbsp; So it blew all night long while I was writing up my
journal, and after we were in bed, under a cloudless, starset
heaven; and so it was blowing still next morning when we
rose.</p>
<p>It was a laughable thought to us, what had become of our
cheerful, wandering Hebrews.&nbsp; We could not suppose they had
reached a destination.&nbsp; The meanest boy could lead them
miles out of their way to see a gopher-hole.&nbsp; Boys, we felt
to be their special danger; none others were of that exact pitch
of cheerful irrelevancy to exercise a kindred sway upon their
minds: but before the attractions of a boy their most settled
resolutions would be war.&nbsp; We thought we could follow in
fancy these three aged Hebrew truants wandering in and out on
hilltop and in thicket, a demon boy trotting far ahead, their
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp conductor; and at last about midnight, the
wind still roaring in the darkness, we had a vision of all three
on their knees upon a mountain-top around a glow-worm.</p>
<h3><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>CHAPTER III. THE RETURN</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning we were up by
half-past five, according to agreement, and it was ten by the
clock before our Jew boys returned to pick us up.&nbsp; Kelmar,
Mrs. Kelmar, and Abramina, all smiling from ear to ear, and full
of tales of the hospitality they had found on the other
side.&nbsp; It had not gone unrewarded; for I observed with
interest that the ship&rsquo;s kettles, all but one, had been
&ldquo;placed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three Lake County families, at least,
endowed for life with a ship&rsquo;s kettle.&nbsp; Come, this was
no misspent Sunday.&nbsp; The absence of the kettles told its own
story: our Jews said nothing about them; but, on the other hand,
they said many kind and comely things about the people they had
met.&nbsp; The two women, in particular, had been charmed out of
themselves by the sight of a young girl surrounded by her
admirers; all evening, it appeared, they had been triumphing
together in the girl&rsquo;s innocent successes, and to this
natural and unselfish joy they gave expression in language that
was beautiful by its simplicity and truth.</p>
<p>Take them for all in all, few people have done my heart more
good; they seemed so thoroughly entitled to happiness, and to
enjoy it in so large a measure and so free from after-thought;
almost they persuaded me to be a Jew.&nbsp; There was, indeed, a
chink of money in their talk.&nbsp; They particularly commanded
people who were well to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He</i> don&rsquo;t
care&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; was their highest word of
commendation to an individual fate; and here I seem to grasp the
root of their philosophy&mdash;it was to be free from care, to be
free to make these Sunday wanderings, that they so eagerly
pursued after wealth; and all this carefulness was to be
careless.&nbsp; The fine, good humour of all three seemed to
declare they had attained their end.&nbsp; Yet there was the
other side to it; and the recipients of kettles perhaps cared
greatly.</p>
<p>No sooner had they returned, than the scene of yesterday began
again.&nbsp; The horses were not even tied with a straw rope this
time&mdash;it was not worth while; and Kelmar disappeared into
the bar, leaving them under a tree on the other side of the
road.&nbsp; I had to devote myself.&nbsp; I stood under the
shadow of that tree for, I suppose, hard upon an hour, and had
not the heart to be angry.&nbsp; Once some one remembered me, and
brought me out half a tumblerful of the playful, innocuous
American cocktail.&nbsp; I drank it, and lo! veins of living fire
ran down my leg; and then a focus of conflagration remained
seated in my stomach, not unpleasantly, for quarter of an
hour.&nbsp; I love these sweet, fiery pangs, but I will not court
them.&nbsp; The bulk of the time I spent in repeating as much
French poetry as I could remember to the horses, who seemed to
enjoy it hugely.&nbsp; And now it went&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O ma vieille Font-georges<br />
O&ugrave; volent les rouges-gorges:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and again, to a more trampling measure&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et tout tremble, Irun, Co&iuml;mbre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sautander, Almodovar,<br />
Sit&ocirc;t qu&rsquo;on entend le timbre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Des cymbales do Bivar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The redbreasts and the brooks of Europe, in that dry and
songless land; brave old names and wars, strong cities, cymbals,
and bright armour, in that nook of the mountain, sacred only to
the Indian and the bear!&nbsp; This is still the strangest thing
in all man&rsquo;s travelling, that he should carry about with
him incongruous memories.&nbsp; There is no foreign land; it is
the traveller only that is foreign, and now and again, by a flash
of recollection, lights up the contrasts of the earth.</p>
<p>But while I was thus wandering in my fancy, great feats had
been transacted in the bar.&nbsp; Corwin the bold had fallen,
Kelmar was again crowned with laurels, and the last of the
ship&rsquo;s kettles had changed hands.&nbsp; If I had ever
doubted the purity of Kelmar&rsquo;s motives, if I had ever
suspected him of a single eye to business in his eternal
dallyings, now at least, when the last kettle was disposed of, my
suspicions must have been allayed.&nbsp; I dare not guess how
much more time was wasted; nor how often we drove off, merely to
drive back again and renew interrupted conversations about
nothing, before the Toll House was fairly left behind.&nbsp;
Alas! and not a mile down the grade there stands a ranche in a
sunny vineyard, and here we must all dismount again and
enter.</p>
<p>Only the old lady was at home, Mrs. Guele, a brown old Swiss
dame, the picture of honesty; and with her we drank a bottle of
wine and had an age-long conversation, which would have been
highly delightful if Fanny and I had not been faint with
hunger.&nbsp; The ladies each narrated the story of her marriage,
our two Hebrews with the prettiest combination of sentiment and
financial bathos.&nbsp; Abramina, specially, endeared herself
with every word.&nbsp; She was as simple, natural, and engaging
as a kid that should have been brought up to the business of a
money-changer.&nbsp; One touch was so resplendently Hebraic that
I cannot pass it over.&nbsp; When her &ldquo;old man&rdquo; wrote
home for her from America, her old man&rsquo;s family would not
intrust her with the money for the passage, till she had bound
herself by an oath&mdash;on her knees, I think she said&mdash;not
to employ it otherwise.</p>
<p>This had tickled Abramina hugely, but I think it tickled me
fully more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Guele told of her home-sickness up here in the long
winters; of her honest, country-woman troubles and alarms upon
the journey; how in the bank at Frankfort she had feared lest the
banker, after having taken her cheque, should deny all knowledge
of it&mdash;a fear I have myself every time I go to a bank; and
how crossing the Luneburger Heath, an old lady, witnessing her
trouble and finding whither she was bound, had given her
&ldquo;the blessing of a person eighty years old, which would be
sure to bring her safely to the States.&nbsp; And the first thing
I did,&rdquo; added Mrs. Guele, &ldquo;was to fall
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length we got out of the house, and some of us into the
trap, when&mdash;judgment of Heaven!&mdash;here came Mr. Guele
from his vineyard.&nbsp; So another quarter of an hour went by;
till at length, at our earnest pleading, we set forth again in
earnest, Fanny and I white-faced and silent, but the Jews still
smiling.&nbsp; The heart fails me.&nbsp; There was yet another
stoppage!&nbsp; And we drove at last into Calistoga past two in
the afternoon, Fanny and I having breakfasted at six in the
morning, eight mortal hours before.&nbsp; We were a pallid
couple; but still the Jews were smiling.</p>
<p>So ended our excursion with the village usurers; and, now that
it was done, we had no more idea of the nature of the business,
nor of the part we had been playing in it, than the child
unborn.&nbsp; That all the people we had met were the slaves of
Kelmar, though in various degrees of servitude; that we ourselves
had been sent up the mountain in the interests of none but
Kelmar; that the money we laid out, dollar by dollar, cent by
cent, and through the hands of various intermediaries, should all
hop ultimately into Kelmar&rsquo;s till;&mdash;these were facts
that we only grew to recognize in the course of time and by the
accumulation of evidence.&nbsp; At length all doubt was quieted,
when one of the kettle-holders confessed.&nbsp; Stopping his trap
in the moonlight, a little way out of Calistoga, he told me, in
so many words, that he dare not show face therewith an empty
pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t mind if it was only
five dollars, Mr. Stevens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I must give
Mr. Kelmar <i>something</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even now, when the whole tyranny is plain to me, I cannot find
it in my heart to be as angry as perhaps I should be with the
Hebrew tyrant.&nbsp; The whole game of business is beggar my
neighbour; and though perhaps that game looks uglier when played
at such close quarters and on so small a scale, it is none the
more intrinsically inhumane for that.&nbsp; The village usurer is
not so sad a feature of humanity and human progress as the
millionaire manufacturer, fattening on the toil and loss of
thousands, and yet declaiming from the platform against the greed
and dishonesty of landlords.&nbsp; If it were fair for Cobden to
buy up land from owners whom he thought unconscious of its proper
value, it was fair enough for my Russian Jew to give credit to
his farmers.&nbsp; Kelmar, if he was unconscious of the beam in
his own eye, was at least silent in the matter of his
brother&rsquo;s mote.</p>
<h2><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>THE
ACT OF SQUATTING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were four of us
squatters&mdash;myself and my wife, the King and Queen of
Silverado; Sam, the Crown Prince; and Chuchu, the Grand
Duke.&nbsp; Chuchu, a setter crossed with spaniel, was the most
unsuited for a rough life.&nbsp; He had been nurtured tenderly in
the society of ladies; his heart was large and soft; he regarded
the sofa-cushion as a bed-rook necessary of existence.&nbsp;
Though about the size of a sheep, he loved to sit in
ladies&rsquo; laps; he never said a bad word in all his blameless
days; and if he had seen a flute, I am sure he could have played
upon it by nature.&nbsp; It may seem hard to say it of a dog, but
Chuchu was a tame cat.</p>
<p>The king and queen, the grand duke, and a basket of cold
provender for immediate use, set forth from Calistoga in a double
buggy; the crown prince, on horseback, led the way like an
outrider.&nbsp; Bags and boxes and a second-hand stove were to
follow close upon our heels by Hanson&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful still day; the sky was one field of
azure.&nbsp; Not a leaf moved, not a speck appeared in
heaven.&nbsp; Only from the summit of the mountain one little
snowy wisp of cloud after another kept detaching itself, like
smoke from a volcano, and blowing southward in some high stream
of air: Mount Saint Helena still at her interminable task, making
the weather, like a Lapland witch.</p>
<p>By noon we had come in sight of the mill: a great brown
building, half-way up the hill, big as a factory, two stories
high, and with tanks and ladders along the roof; which, as a
pendicle of Silverado mine, we held to be an outlying province of
our own.&nbsp; Thither, then, we went, crossing the valley by a
grassy trail; and there lunched out of the basket, sitting in a
kind of portico, and wondering, while we ate, at this great bulk
of useless building.&nbsp; Through a chink we could look far down
into the interior, and see sunbeams floating in the dust and
striking on tier after tier of silent, rusty machinery.&nbsp; It
cost six thousand dollars, twelve hundred English sovereigns; and
now, here it stands deserted, like the temple of a forgotten
religion, the busy millers toiling somewhere else.&nbsp; All the
time we were there, mill and mill town showed no sign of life;
that part of the mountain-side, which is very open and green, was
tenanted by no living creature but ourselves and the insects; and
nothing stirred but the cloud manufactory upon the mountain
summit.&nbsp; It was odd to compare this with the former days,
when the engine was in fall blast, the mill palpitating to its
strokes, and the carts came rattling down from Silverado, charged
with ore.</p>
<p>By two we had been landed at the mine, the buggy was gone
again, and we were left to our own reflections and the basket of
cold provender, until Hanson should arrive.&nbsp; Hot as it was
by the sun, there was something chill in such a home-coming, in
that world of wreck and rust, splinter and rolling gravel, where
for so many years no fire had smoked.</p>
<p>Silverado platform filled the whole width of the canyon.&nbsp;
Above, as I have said, this was a wild, red, stony gully in the
mountains; but below it was a wooded dingle.&nbsp; And through
this, I was told, there had gone a path between the mine and the
Toll House&mdash;our natural north-west passage to
civilization.&nbsp; I found and followed it, clearing my way as I
went through fallen branches and dead trees.&nbsp; It went
straight down that steep canyon, till it brought you out abruptly
over the roofs of the hotel.&nbsp; There was nowhere any break in
the descent.&nbsp; It almost seemed as if, were you to drop a
stone down the old iron chute at our platform, it would never
rest until it hopped upon the Toll House shingles.&nbsp; Signs
were not wanting of the ancient greatness of Silverado.&nbsp; The
footpath was well marked, and had been well trodden in the old
clays by thirsty miners.&nbsp; And far down, buried in foliage,
deep out of sight of Silverado, I came on a last outpost of the
mine&mdash;a mound of gravel, some wreck of wooden aqueduct, and
the mouth of a tunnel, like a treasure grotto in a fairy
story.&nbsp; A stream of water, fed by the invisible leakage from
our shaft, and dyed red with cinnabar or iron, ran trippingly
forth out of the bowels of the cave; and, looking far under the
arch, I could see something like an iron lantern fastened on the
rocky wall.&nbsp; It was a promising spot for the
imagination.&nbsp; No boy could have left it unexplored.</p>
<p>The stream thenceforward stole along the bottom of the dingle,
and made, for that dry land, a pleasant warbling in the
leaves.&nbsp; Once, I suppose, it ran splashing down the whole
length of the canyon, but now its head waters had been tapped by
the shaft at Silverado, and for a great part of its course it
wandered sunless among the joints of the mountain.&nbsp; No
wonder that it should better its pace when it sees, far before
it, daylight whitening in the arch, or that it should come
trotting forth into the sunlight with a song.</p>
<p>The two stages had gone by when I got down, and the Toll House
stood, dozing in sun and dust and silence, like a place
enchanted.&nbsp; My mission was after hay for bedding, and that I
was readily promised.&nbsp; But when I mentioned that we were
waiting for Rufe, the people shook their heads.&nbsp; Rufe was
not a regular man any way, it seemed; and if he got playing
poker&mdash;Well, poker was too many for Rufe.&nbsp; I had not
yet heard them bracketted together; but it seemed a natural
conjunction, and commended itself swiftly to my fears; and as
soon as I returned to Silverado and had told my story, we
practically gave Hanson up, and set ourselves to do what we could
find do-able in our desert-island state.</p>
<p>The lower room had been the assayer&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; The
floor was thick with <i>d&eacute;bris</i>&mdash;part human, from
the former occupants; part natural, sifted in by mountain
winds.&nbsp; In a sea of red dust there swam or floated sticks,
boards, hay, straw, stones, and paper; ancient newspapers, above
all&mdash;for the newspaper, especially when torn, soon becomes
an antiquity&mdash;and bills of the Silverado boarding-house,
some dated Silverado, some Calistoga Mine.&nbsp; Here is one,
verbatim; and if any one can calculate the scale of charges, he
has my envious admiration.</p>

<p>Where is John Stanley mining now?&nbsp; Where is S. Chapman,
within whose hospitable walls we were to lodge?&nbsp; The date
was but five years old, but in that time the world had changed
for Silverado; like Palmyra in the desert, it had outlived its
people and its purpose; we camped, like Layard, amid ruins, and
these names spoke to us of prehistoric time.&nbsp; A boot-jack, a
pair of boots, a dog-hutch, and these bills of Mr.
Chapman&rsquo;s were the only speaking relics that we disinterred
from all that vast Silverado rubbish-heap; but what would I not
have given to unearth a letter, a pocket-book, a diary, only a
ledger, or a roll of names, to take me back, in a more personal
manner, to the past?&nbsp; It pleases me, besides, to fancy that
Stanley or Chapman, or one of their companions, may light upon
this chronicle, and be struck by the name, and read some news of
their anterior home, coming, as it were, out of a subsequent
epoch of history in that quarter of the world.</p>
<p>As we were tumbling the mingled rubbish on the floor, kicking
it with our feet, and groping for these written evidences of the
past, Sam, with a somewhat whitened face, produced a paper
bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; It
contained a granulated powder, something the colour of
Gregory&rsquo;s Mixture, but rosier; and as there were several of
the bags, and each more or less broken, the powder was spread
widely on the floor.&nbsp; Had any of us ever seen giant
powder?&nbsp; No, nobody had; and instantly there grew up in my
mind a shadowy belief, verging with every moment nearer to
certitude, that I had somewhere heard somebody describe it as
just such a powder as the one around us.&nbsp; I have learnt
since that it is a substance not unlike tallow, and is made up in
rolls for all the world like tallow candles.</p>
<p>Fanny, to add to our happiness, told us a story of a gentleman
who had camped one night, like ourselves, by a deserted
mine.&nbsp; He was a handy, thrifty fellow, and looked right and
left for plunder, but all he could lay his hands on was a can of
oil.&nbsp; After dark he had to see to the horses with a lantern;
and not to miss an opportunity, filled up his lamp from the oil
can.&nbsp; Thus equipped, he set forth into the forest.&nbsp; A
little while after, his friends heard a loud explosion; the
mountain echoes bellowed, and then all was still.&nbsp; On
examination, the can proved to contain oil, with the trifling
addition of nitro-glycerine; but no research disclosed a trace of
either man or lantern.</p>
<p>It was a pretty sight, after this anecdote, to see us sweeping
out the giant powder.&nbsp; It seemed never to be far enough
away.&nbsp; And, after all, it was only some rock pounded for
assay.</p>
<p>So much for the lower room.&nbsp; We scraped some of the
rougher dirt off the floor, and left it.&nbsp; That was our
sitting-room and kitchen, though there was nothing to sit upon
but the table, and no provision for a fire except a hole in the
roof of the room above, which had once contained the chimney of a
stove.</p>
<p>To that upper room we now proceeded.&nbsp; There were the
eighteen bunks in a double tier, nine on either hand, where from
eighteen to thirty-six miners had once snored together all night
long, John Stanley, perhaps, snoring loudest.&nbsp; There was the
roof, with a hole in it through which the sun now shot an
arrow.&nbsp; There was the floor, in much the same state as the
one below, though, perhaps, there was more hay, and certainly
there was the added ingredient of broken glass, the man who stole
the window-frames having apparently made a miscarriage with this
one.&nbsp; Without a broom, without hay or bedding, we could but
look about us with a beginning of despair.&nbsp; The one bright
arrow of day, in that gaunt and shattered barrack, made the rest
look dirtier and darker, and the sight drove us at last into the
open.</p>
<p>Here, also, the handiwork of man lay ruined: but the plants
were all alive and thriving; the view below was fresh with the
colours of nature; and we had exchanged a dim, human garret for a
corner, even although it were untidy, of the blue hall of
heaven.&nbsp; Not a bird, not a beast, not a reptile.&nbsp; There
was no noise in that part of the world, save when we passed
beside the staging, and heard the water musically falling in the
shaft.</p>
<p>We wandered to and fro.&nbsp; We searched among that drift of
lumber-wood and iron, nails and rails, and sleepers and the
wheels of tracks.&nbsp; We gazed up the cleft into the bosom of
the mountain.&nbsp; We sat by the margin of the dump and saw, far
below us, the green treetops standing still in the clear
air.&nbsp; Beautiful perfumes, breaths of bay, resin, and nutmeg,
came to us more often and grew sweeter and sharper as the
afternoon declined.&nbsp; But still there was no word of
Hanson.</p>
<p>I set to with pick and shovel, and deepened the pool behind
the shaft, till we were sure of sufficient water for the morning;
and by the time I had finished, the sun had begun to go down
behind the mountain shoulder, the platform was plunged in quiet
shadow, and a chill descended from the sky.&nbsp; Night began
early in our cleft.&nbsp; Before us, over the margin of the dump,
we could see the sun still striking aslant into the wooded nick
below, and on the battlemented, pine-bescattered ridges on the
farther side.</p>
<p>There was no stove, of course, and no hearth in our lodging,
so we betook ourselves to the blacksmith&rsquo;s forge across the
platform.&nbsp; If the platform be taken as a stage, and the
out-curving margin of the dump to represent the line of the
foot-lights, then our house would be the first wing on the
actor&rsquo;s left, and this blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, although
no match for it in size, the foremost on the right.&nbsp; It was
a low, brown cottage, planted close against the hill, and
overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona
thicket.&nbsp; Within it was full of dead leaves and mountain
dust, and rubbish from the mine.&nbsp; But we soon had a good
fire brightly blazing, and sat close about it on impromptu
seats.&nbsp; Chuchu, the slave of sofa-cushions, whimpered for a
softer bed; but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted
by that good creature-fire, which gives us warmth and light and
companionable sounds, and colours up the emptiest building with
better than frescoes.&nbsp; For a while it was even pleasant in
the forge, with the blaze in the midst, and a look over our
shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like
a dolphin.</p>
<p>It was between seven and eight before Hanson arrived, with a
waggonful of our effects and two of his wife&rsquo;s relatives to
lend him a hand.&nbsp; The elder showed surprising
strength.&nbsp; He would pick up a huge packing-case, full of
books of all things, swing it on his shoulder, and away up the
two crazy ladders and the breakneck spout of rolling mineral,
familiarly termed a path, that led from the cart-track to our
house.&nbsp; Even for a man unburthened, the ascent was toilsome
and precarious; but Irvine sealed it with a light foot, carrying
box after box, as the hero whisks the stage child up the
practicable footway beside the waterfall of the fifth act.&nbsp;
With so strong a helper, the business was speedily
transacted.&nbsp; Soon the assayer&rsquo;s office was thronged
with our belongings, piled higgledy-piggledy, and upside down,
about the floor.&nbsp; There were our boxes, indeed, but my wife
had left her keys in Calistoga.&nbsp; There was the stove, but,
alas! our carriers had forgot the chimney, and lost one of the
plates along the road.&nbsp; The Silverado problem was scarce
solved.</p>
<p>Rufe himself was grave and good-natured over his share of
blame; he even, if I remember right, expressed regret.&nbsp; But
his crew, to my astonishment and anger, grinned from ear to ear,
and laughed aloud at our distress.&nbsp; They thought it
&ldquo;real funny&rdquo; about the stove-pipe they had forgotten;
&ldquo;real funny&rdquo; that they should have lost a
plate.&nbsp; As for hay, the whole party refused to bring us any
till they should have supped.&nbsp; See how late they were!&nbsp;
Never had there been such a job as coming up that grade!&nbsp;
Nor often, I suspect, such a game of poker as that before they
started.&nbsp; But about nine, as a particular favour, we should
have some hay.</p>
<p>So they took their departure, leaving me still staring, and we
resigned ourselves to wait for their return.&nbsp; The fire in
the forge had been suffered to go out, and we were one and all
too weary to kindle another.&nbsp; We dined, or, not to take that
word in vain, we ate after a fashion, in the nightmare disorder
of the assayer&rsquo;s office, perched among boxes.&nbsp; A
single candle lighted us.&nbsp; It could scarce be called a
housewarming; for there was, of course, no fire, and with the two
open doors and the open window gaping on the night, like breaches
in a fortress, it began to grow rapidly chill.&nbsp; Talk ceased;
nobody moved but the unhappy Chuchu, still in quest of
sofa-cushions, who tumbled complainingly among the trunks.&nbsp;
It required a certain happiness of disposition to look forward
hopefully, from so dismal a beginning, across the brief hours of
night, to the warm shining of to-morrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<p>But the hay arrived at last, and we turned, with our last
spark of courage, to the bedroom.&nbsp; We had improved the
entrance, but it was still a kind of rope-walking; and it would
have been droll to see us mounting, one after another, by
candle-light, under the open stars.</p>
<p>The western door&mdash;that which looked up the canyon, and
through which we entered by our bridge of flying plank&mdash;was
still entire, a handsome, panelled door, the most finished piece
of carpentry in Silverado.&nbsp; And the two lowest bunks next to
this we roughly filled with hay for that night&rsquo;s use.&nbsp;
Through the opposite, or eastern-looking gable, with its open
door and window, a faint, disused starshine came into the room
like mist; and when we were once in bed, we lay, awaiting sleep,
in a haunted, incomplete obscurity.&nbsp; At first the silence of
the night was utter.&nbsp; Then a high wind began in the distance
among the treetops, and for hours continued to grow higher.&nbsp;
It seemed to me much such a wind as we had found on our visit;
yet here in our open chamber we were fanned only by gentle and
refreshing draughts, so deep was the canyon, so close our house
was planted under the overhanging rock.</p>
<h2><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>THE
HUNTER&rsquo;S FAMILY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is quite a large race or
class of people in America, for whom we scarcely seem to have a
parallel in England.&nbsp; Of pure white blood, they are unknown
or unrecognizable in towns; inhabit the fringe of settlements and
the deep, quiet places of the country; rebellious to all labour,
and pettily thievish, like the English gipsies; rustically
ignorant, but with a touch of wood-lore and the dexterity of the
savage.&nbsp; Whence they came is a moot point.&nbsp; At the time
of the war, they poured north in crowds to escape the
conscription; lived during summer on fruits, wild animals, and
petty theft; and at the approach of winter, when these supplies
failed, built great fires in the forest, and there died stoically
by starvation.&nbsp; They are widely scattered, however, and
easily recognized.&nbsp; Loutish, but not ill-looking, they will
sit all day, swinging their legs on a field fence, the mind
seemingly as devoid of all reflection as a Suffolk
peasant&rsquo;s, careless of politics, for the most part
incapable of reading, but with a rebellious vanity and a strong
sense of independence.&nbsp; Hunting is their most congenial
business, or, if the occasion offers, a little amateur
detection.&nbsp; In tracking a criminal, following a particular
horse along a beaten highway, and drawing inductions from a hair
or a footprint, one of those somnolent, grinning Hodges will
suddenly display activity of body and finesse of mind.&nbsp; By
their names ye may know them, the women figuring as Loveina,
Larsenia, Serena, Leanna, Orreana; the men answering to Alvin,
Alva, or Orion, pronounced Orrion, with the accent on the
first.&nbsp; Whether they are indeed a race, or whether this is
the form of degeneracy common to all back-woodsmen, they are at
least known by a generic byword, as Poor Whites or
Low-downers.</p>
<p>I will not say that the Hanson family was Poor White, because
the name savours of offence; but I may go as far as
this&mdash;they were, in many points, not unsimilar to the people
usually so-cared.&nbsp; Rufe himself combined two of the
qualifications, for he was both a hunter and an amateur
detective.&nbsp; It was he who pursued Russel and Dollar, the
robbers of the Lake Port stage, and captured them the very
morning after the exploit, while they were still sleeping in a
hayfield.&nbsp; Russel, a drunken Scotch carpenter, was even an
acquaintance of his own, and he expressed much grave
commiseration for his fate.&nbsp; In all that he said and did,
Rufe was grave.&nbsp; I never saw him hurried.&nbsp; When he
spoke, he took out his pipe with ceremonial deliberation, looked
east and west, and then, in quiet tones and few words, stated his
business or told his story.&nbsp; His gait was to match; it would
never have surprised you if, at any step, he had turned round and
walked away again, so warily and slowly, and with so much seeming
hesitation did he go about.&nbsp; He lay long in bed in the
morning&mdash;rarely indeed, rose before noon; he loved all
games, from poker to clerical croquet; and in the Toll House
croquet ground I have seen him toiling at the latter with the
devotion of a curate.&nbsp; He took an interest in education, was
an active member of the local school-board, and when I was there,
he had recently lost the schoolhouse key.&nbsp; His waggon was
broken, but it never seemed to occur to him to mend it.&nbsp;
Like all truly idle people, he had an artistic eye.&nbsp; He
chose the print stuff for his wife&rsquo;s dresses, and
counselled her in the making of a patchwork quilt, always, as she
thought, wrongly, but to the more educated eye, always with
bizarre and admirable taste&mdash;the taste of an Indian.&nbsp;
With all this, he was a perfect, unoffending gentleman in word
and act.&nbsp; Take his clay pipe from him, and he was fit for
any society but that of fools.&nbsp; Quiet as he was, there
burned a deep, permanent excitement in his dark blue eyes; and
when this grave man smiled, it was like sunshine in a shady
place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hanson (<i>n&eacute;e</i>, if you please, Lovelands) was
more commonplace than her lord.&nbsp; She was a comely woman,
too, plump, fair-coloured, with wonderful white teeth; and in her
print dresses (chosen by Rufe) and with a large sun-bonnet
shading her valued complexion, made, I assure you, a very
agreeable figure.&nbsp; But she was on the surface, what there
was of her, out-spoken and loud-spoken.&nbsp; Her noisy laughter
had none of the charm of one of Hanson&rsquo;s rare,
slow-spreading smiles; there was no reticence, no mystery, no
manner about the woman: she was a first-class dairymaid, but her
husband was an unknown quantity between the savage and the
nobleman.&nbsp; She was often in and out with us, merry, and
healthy, and fair; he came far seldomer&mdash;only, indeed, when
there was business, or now and again, to pay a visit of ceremony,
brushed up for the occasion, with his wife on his arm, and a
clean clay pipe in his teeth.&nbsp; These visits, in our forest
state, had quite the air of an event, and turned our red canyon
into a salon.</p>
<p>Such was the pair who ruled in the old Silverado Hotel, among
the windy trees, on the mountain shoulder overlooking the whole
length of Napa Valley, as the man aloft looks down on the
ship&rsquo;s deck.&nbsp; There they kept house, with sundry
horses and fowls, and a family of sons, Daniel Webster, and I
think George Washington, among the number.&nbsp; Nor did they
want visitors.&nbsp; An old gentleman, of singular stolidity, and
called Breedlove&mdash;I think he had crossed the plains in the
same caravan with Rufe&mdash;housed with them for awhile during
our stay; and they had besides a permanent lodger, in the form of
Mrs. Hanson&rsquo;s brother, Irvine Lovelands.&nbsp; I spell
Irvine by guess; for I could get no information on the subject,
just as I could never find out, in spite of many inquiries,
whether or not Rufe was a contraction for Rufus.&nbsp; They were
all cheerfully at sea about their names in that generation.&nbsp;
And this is surely the more notable where the names are all so
strange, and even the family names appear to have been
coined.&nbsp; At one time, at least, the ancestors of all these
Alvins and Alvas, Loveinas, Lovelands, and Breedloves, must have
taken serious council and found a certain poetry in these
denominations; that must have been, then, their form of
literature.&nbsp; But still times change; and their next
descendants, the George Washingtons and Daniel Websters, will at
least be clear upon the point.&nbsp; And anyway, and however his
name should be spelt, this Irvine Lovelands was the most
unmitigated Caliban I ever knew.</p>
<p>Our very first morning at Silverado, when we were full of
business, patching up doors and windows, making beds and seats,
and getting our rough lodging into shape, Irvine and his sister
made their appearance together, she for neighbourliness and
general curiosity; he, because he was working for me, to my
sorrow, cutting firewood at I forget how much a day.&nbsp; The
way that he set about cutting wood was characteristic.&nbsp; We
were at that moment patching up and unpacking in the
kitchen.&nbsp; Down he sat on one side, and down sat his sister
on the other.&nbsp; Both were chewing pine-tree gum, and he, to
my annoyance, accompanied that simple pleasure with profuse
expectoration.&nbsp; She rattled away, talking up hill and down
dale, laughing, tossing her head, showing her brilliant
teeth.&nbsp; He looked on in silence, now spitting heavily on the
floor, now putting his head back and uttering a loud, discordant,
joyless laugh.&nbsp; He had a tangle of shock hair, the colour of
wool; his mouth was a grin; although as strong as a horse, he
looked neither heavy nor yet adroit, only leggy, coltish, and in
the road.&nbsp; But it was plain he was in high spirits,
thoroughly enjoying his visit; and he laughed frankly whenever we
failed to accomplish what we were about.&nbsp; This was scarcely
helpful: it was even, to amateur carpenters, embarrassing; but it
lasted until we knocked off work and began to get dinner.&nbsp;
Then Mrs. Hanson remembered she should have been gone an hour
ago; and the pair retired, and the lady&rsquo;s laughter died
away among the nutmegs down the path.&nbsp; That was
Irvine&rsquo;s first day&rsquo;s work in my employment&mdash;the
devil take him!</p>
<p>The next morning he returned and, as he was this time alone,
he bestowed his conversation upon us with great liberality.&nbsp;
He prided himself on his intelligence; asked us if we knew the
school ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t think much of
her, anyway.&nbsp; He had tried her, he had.&nbsp; He had put a
question to her.&nbsp; If a tree a hundred feet high were to fall
a foot a day, how long would it take to fall right down?&nbsp;
She had not been able to solve the problem.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
don&rsquo;t know nothing,&rdquo; he opined.&nbsp; He told us how
a friend of his kept a school with a revolver, and chuckled
mightily over that; his friend could teach school, he
could.&nbsp; All the time he kept chewing gum and spitting.&nbsp;
He would stand a while looking down; and then he would toss back
his shock of hair, and laugh hoarsely, and spit, and bring
forward a new subject.&nbsp; A man, he told us, who bore a grudge
against him, had poisoned his dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was a low
thing for a man to do now, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
like a man, that, nohow.&nbsp; But I got even with him: I pisoned
<i>his</i> dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; His clumsy utterance, his rude
embarrassed manner, set a fresh value on the stupidity of his
remarks.&nbsp; I do not think I ever appreciated the meaning of
two words until I knew Irvine&mdash;the verb, loaf, and the noun,
oaf; between them, they complete his portrait.&nbsp; He could
lounge, and wriggle, and rub himself against the wall, and grin,
and be more in everybody&rsquo;s way than any other two people
that I ever set my eyes on.&nbsp; Nothing that he did became him;
and yet you were conscious that he was one of your own race, that
his mind was cumbrously at work, revolving the problem of
existence like a quid of gum, and in his own cloudy manner
enjoying life, and passing judgment on his fellows.&nbsp; Above
all things, he was delighted with himself.&nbsp; You would not
have thought it, from his uneasy manners and troubled, struggling
utterance; but he loved himself to the marrow, and was happy and
proud like a peacock on a rail.</p>
<p>His self-esteem was, indeed, the one joint in his
harness.&nbsp; He could be got to work, and even kept at work, by
flattery.&nbsp; As long as my wife stood over him, crying out how
strong he was, so long exactly he would stick to the matter in
hand; and the moment she turned her back, or ceased to praise
him, he would stop.&nbsp; His physical strength was wonderful;
and to have a woman stand by and admire his achievements, warmed
his heart like sunshine.&nbsp; Yet he was as cowardly as he was
powerful, and felt no shame in owning to the weakness.&nbsp;
Something was once wanted from the crazy platform over the shaft,
and he at once refused to venture there&mdash;&ldquo;did not
like,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;foolen&rsquo; round them kind
o&rsquo; places,&rdquo; and let my wife go instead of him,
looking on with a grin.&nbsp; Vanity, where it rules, is usually
more heroic: but Irvine steadily approved himself, and expected
others to approve him; rather looked down upon my wife, and
decidedly expected her to look up to him, on the strength of his
superior prudence.</p>
<p>Yet the strangest part of the whole matter was perhaps this,
that Irvine was as beautiful as a statue.&nbsp; His features
were, in themselves, perfect; it was only his cloudy, uncouth,
and coarse expression that disfigured them.&nbsp; So much
strength residing in so spare a frame was proof sufficient of the
accuracy of his shape.&nbsp; He must have been built somewhat
after the pattern of Jack Sheppard; but the famous housebreaker,
we may be certain, was no lout.&nbsp; It was by the extraordinary
powers of his mind no less than by the vigour of his body, that
he broke his strong prison with such imperfect implements,
turning the very obstacles to service.&nbsp; Irvine, in the same
case, would have sat down and spat, and grumbled curses.&nbsp; He
had the soul of a fat sheep, but, regarded as an artist&rsquo;s
model, the exterior of a Greek God.&nbsp; It was a cruel thought
to persons less favoured in their birth, that this creature,
endowed&mdash;to use the language of theatres&mdash;with
extraordinary &ldquo;means,&rdquo; should so manage to misemploy
them that he looked ugly and almost deformed.&nbsp; It was only
by an effort of abstraction, and after many days, that you
discovered what he was.</p>
<p>By playing on the oaf&rsquo;s conceit, and standing closely
over him, we got a path made round the corner of the dump to our
door, so that we could come and go with decent ease; and he even
enjoyed the work, for in that there were boulders to be plucked
up bodily, bushes to be uprooted, and other occasions for
athletic display: but cutting wood was a different matter.&nbsp;
Anybody could cut wood; and, besides, my wife was tired of
supervising him, and had other things to attend to.&nbsp; And, in
short, days went by, and Irvine came daily, and talked and
lounged and spat; but the firewood remained intact as sleepers on
the platform or growing trees upon the mountainside.&nbsp;
Irvine, as a woodcutter, we could tolerate; but Irvine as a
friend of the family, at so much a day, was too bald an
imposition, and at length, on the afternoon of the fourth or
fifth day of our connection, I explained to him, as clearly as I
could, the light in which I had grown to regard his
presence.&nbsp; I pointed out to him that I could not continue to
give him a salary for spitting on the floor; and this expression,
which came after a good many others, at last penetrated his
obdurate wits.&nbsp; He rose at once, and said if that was the
way he was going to be spoke to, he reckoned he would quit.&nbsp;
And, no one interposing, he departed.</p>
<p>So far, so good.&nbsp; But we had no firewood.&nbsp; The next
afternoon, I strolled down to Rufe&rsquo;s and consulted him on
the subject.&nbsp; It was a very droll interview, in the large,
bare north room of the Silverado Hotel, Mrs. Hanson&rsquo;s
patchwork on a frame, and Rufe, and his wife, and I, and the oaf
himself, all more or less embarrassed.&nbsp; Rufe announced there
was nobody in the neighbourhood but Irvine who could do a
day&rsquo;s work for anybody.&nbsp; Irvine, thereupon, refused to
have any more to do with my service; he &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t
work no more for a man as had spoke to him&rsquo;s I had
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; I found myself on the point of the last
humiliation&mdash;driven to beseech the creature whom I had just
dismissed with insult: but I took the high hand in despair, said
there must be no talk of Irvine coming back unless matters were
to be differently managed; that I would rather chop firewood for
myself than be fooled; and, in short, the Hansons being eager for
the lad&rsquo;s hire, I so imposed upon them with merely affected
resolution, that they ended by begging me to re-employ him again,
on a solemn promise that he should be more industrious.&nbsp; The
promise, I am bound to say, was kept.&nbsp; We soon had a fine
pile of firewood at our door; and if Caliban gave me the cold
shoulder and spared me his conversation, I thought none the worse
of him for that, nor did I find my days much longer for the
deprivation.</p>
<p>The leading spirit of the family was, I am inclined to fancy,
Mrs. Hanson.&nbsp; Her social brilliancy somewhat dazzled the
others, and she had more of the small change of sense.&nbsp; It
was she who faced Kelmar, for instance; and perhaps, if she had
been alone, Kelmar would have had no rule within her doors.&nbsp;
Rufe, to be sure, had a fine, sober, open-air attitude of mind,
seeing the world without exaggeration&mdash;perhaps, we may even
say, without enough; for he lacked, along with the others, that
commercial idealism which puts so high a value on time and
money.&nbsp; Sanity itself is a kind of convention.&nbsp; Perhaps
Rufe was wrong; but, looking on life plainly, he was unable to
perceive that croquet or poker were in any way less important
than, for instance, mending his waggon.&nbsp; Even his own
profession, hunting, was dear to him mainly as a sort of play;
even that he would have neglected, had it not appealed to his
imagination.&nbsp; His hunting-suit, for instance, had cost I
should be afraid to say how many bucks&mdash;the currency in
which he paid his way: it was all befringed, after the Indian
fashion, and it was dear to his heart.&nbsp; The pictorial side
of his daily business was never forgotten.&nbsp; He was even
anxious to stand for his picture in those buckskin hunting
clothes; and I remember how he once warmed almost into
enthusiasm, his dark blue eyes growing perceptibly larger, as he
planned the composition in which he should appear, &ldquo;with
the horns of some real big bucks, and dogs, and a camp on a
crick&rdquo; (creek, stream).</p>
<p>There was no trace in Irvine of this woodland poetry.&nbsp; He
did not care for hunting, nor yet for buckskin suits.&nbsp; He
had never observed scenery.&nbsp; The world, as it appeared to
him, was almost obliterated by his own great grinning figure in
the foreground: Caliban Malvolio.&nbsp; And it seems to me as if,
in the persons of these brothers-in-law, we had the two sides of
rusticity fairly well represented: the hunter living really in
nature; the clodhopper living merely out of society: the one bent
up in every corporal agent to capacity in one pursuit, doing at
least one thing keenly and thoughtfully, and thoroughly alive to
all that touches it; the other in the inert and bestial state,
walking in a faint dream, and taking so dim an impression of the
myriad sides of life that he is truly conscious of nothing but
himself.&nbsp; It is only in the fastnesses of nature, forests,
mountains, and the back of man&rsquo;s beyond, that a creature
endowed with five senses can grow up into the perfection of this
crass and earthy vanity.&nbsp; In towns or the busier country
sides, he is roughly reminded of other men&rsquo;s existence; and
if he learns no more, he learns at least to fear contempt.&nbsp;
But Irvine had come scatheless through life, conscious only of
himself, of his great strength and intelligence; and in the
silence of the universe, to which he did not listen, dwelling
with delight on the sound of his own thoughts.</p>
<h2><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>THE
SEA FOGS</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">change</span> in the colour of the light
usually called me in the morning.&nbsp; By a certain hour, the
long, vertical chinks in our western gable, where the boards had
shrunk and separated, flashed suddenly into my eyes as stripes of
dazzling blue, at once so dark and splendid that I used to marvel
how the qualities could be combined.&nbsp; At an earlier hour,
the heavens in that quarter were still quietly coloured, but the
shoulder of the mountain which shuts in the canyon already glowed
with sunlight in a wonderful compound of gold and rose and green;
and this too would kindle, although more mildly and with rainbow
tints, the fissures of our crazy gable.&nbsp; If I were sleeping
heavily, it was the bold blue that struck me awake; if more
lightly, then I would come to myself in that earlier and fairier
fight.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, about five, the first brightness called
me.&nbsp; I rose and turned to the east, not for my devotions,
but for air.&nbsp; The night had been very still.&nbsp; The
little private gale that blew every evening in our canyon, for
ten minutes or perhaps a quarter of an hour, had swiftly blown
itself out; in the hours that followed not a sigh of wind had
shaken the treetops; and our barrack, for all its breaches, was
less fresh that morning than of wont.&nbsp; But I had no sooner
reached the window than I forgot all else in the sight that met
my eyes, and I made but two bounds into my clothes, and down the
crazy plank to the platform.</p>
<p>The sun was still concealed below the opposite hilltops,
though it was shining already, not twenty feet above my head, on
our own mountain slope.&nbsp; But the scene, beyond a few near
features, was entirely changed.&nbsp; Napa valley was gone; gone
were all the lower slopes and woody foothills of the range; and
in their place, not a thousand feet below me, rolled a great
level ocean.&nbsp; It was as though I had gone to bed the night
before, safe in a nook of inland mountains, and had awakened in a
bay upon the coast.&nbsp; I had seen these inundations from
below; at Calistoga I had risen and gone abroad in the early
morning, coughing and sneezing, under fathoms on fathoms of gray
sea vapour, like a cloudy sky&mdash;a dull sight for the artist,
and a painful experience for the invalid.&nbsp; But to sit aloft
one&rsquo;s self in the pure air and under the unclouded dome of
heaven, and thus look down on the submergence of the valley, was
strangely different and even delightful to the eyes.&nbsp; Far
away were hilltops like little islands.&nbsp; Nearer, a smoky
surf beat about the foot of precipices and poured into all the
coves of these rough mountains.&nbsp; The colour of that fog
ocean was a thing never to be forgotten.&nbsp; For an instant,
among the Hebrides and just about sundown, I have seen something
like it on the sea itself.&nbsp; But the white was not so
opaline; nor was there, what surprisingly increased the effect,
that breathless, crystal stillness over all.&nbsp; Even in its
gentlest moods the salt sea travails, moaning among the weeds or
lisping on the sand; but that vast fog ocean lay in a trance of
silence, nor did the sweet air of the morning tremble with a
sound.</p>
<p>As I continued to sit upon the dump, I began to observe that
this sea was not so level as at first sight it appeared to
be.&nbsp; Away in the extreme south, a little hill of fog arose
against the sky above the general surface, and as it had already
caught the sun, it shone on the horizon like the topsails of some
giant ship.&nbsp; There were huge waves, stationary, as it
seemed, like waves in a frozen sea; and yet, as I looked again, I
was not sure but they were moving after all, with a slow and
august advance.&nbsp; And while I was yet doubting, a promontory
of the some four or five miles away, conspicuous by a bouquet of
tall pines, was in a single instant overtaken and swallowed
up.&nbsp; It reappeared in a little, with its pines, but this
time as an islet, and only to be swallowed up once more and then
for good.&nbsp; This set me looking nearer, and I saw that in
every cove along the line of mountains the fog was being piled in
higher and higher, as though by some wind that was inaudible to
me.&nbsp; I could trace its progress, one pine tree first growing
hazy and then disappearing after another; although sometimes
there was none of this fore-running haze, but the whole opaque
white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain at a
gulp.&nbsp; It was to flee these poisonous fogs that I had left
the seaboard, and climbed so high among the mountains.&nbsp; And
now, behold, here came the fog to besiege me in my chosen
altitudes, and yet came so beautifully that my first thought was
of welcome.</p>
<p>The sun had now gotten much higher, and through all the gaps
of the hills it cast long bars of gold across that white
ocean.&nbsp; An eagle, or some other very great bird of the
mountain, came wheeling over the nearer pine-tops, and hung,
poised and something sideways, as if to look abroad on that
unwonted desolation, spying, perhaps with terror, for the eyries
of her comrades.&nbsp; Then, with a long cry, she disappeared
again towards Lake County and the clearer air.&nbsp; At length it
seemed to me as if the flood were beginning to subside.&nbsp; The
old landmarks, by whose disappearance I had measured its advance,
here a crag, there a brave pine tree, now began, in the inverse
order, to make their reappearance into daylight.&nbsp; I judged
all danger of the fog was over.&nbsp; This was not Noah&rsquo;s
flood; it was but a morning spring, and would now drift out
seaward whence it came.&nbsp; So, mightily relieved, and a good
deal exhilarated by the sight, I went into the house to light the
fire.</p>
<p>I suppose it was nearly seven when I once more mounted the
platform to look abroad.&nbsp; The fog ocean had swelled up
enormously since last I saw it; and a few hundred feet below me,
in the deep gap where the Toll House stands and the road runs
through into Lake County, it had already topped the slope, and
was pouring over and down the other side like driving
smoke.&nbsp; The wind had climbed along with it; and though I was
still in calm air, I could see the trees tossing below me, and
their long, strident sighing mounted to me where I stood.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the fog had surmounted all the ridge on
the opposite side of the gap, though a shoulder of the mountain
still warded it out of our canyon.&nbsp; Napa valley and its
bounding hills were now utterly blotted out.&nbsp; The fog, sunny
white in the sunshine, was pouring over into Lake County in a
huge, ragged cataract, tossing treetops appearing and
disappearing in the spray.&nbsp; The air struck with a little
chill, and set me coughing.&nbsp; It smelt strong of the fog,
like the smell of a washing-house, but with a shrewd tang of the
sea salt.</p>
<p>Had it not been for two things&mdash;the sheltering spur which
answered as a dyke, and the great valley on the other side which
rapidly engulfed whatever mounted&mdash;our own little platform
in the canyon must have been already buried a hundred feet in
salt and poisonous air.&nbsp; As it was, the interest of the
scene entirely occupied our minds.&nbsp; We were set just out of
the wind, and but just above the fog; we could listen to the
voice of the one as to music on the stage; we could plunge our
eyes down into the other, as into some flowing stream from over
the parapet of a bridge; thus we looked on upon a strange,
impetuous, silent, shifting exhibition of the powers of nature,
and saw the familiar landscape changing from moment to moment
like figures in a dream.</p>
<p>The imagination loves to trifle with what is not.&nbsp; Had
this been indeed the deluge, I should have felt more strongly,
but the emotion would have been similar in kind.&nbsp; I played
with the idea, as the child flees in delighted terror from the
creations of his fancy.&nbsp; The look of the thing helped
me.&nbsp; And when at last I began to flee up the mountain, it
was indeed partly to escape from the raw air that kept me
coughing, but it was also part in play.</p>
<p>As I ascended the mountain-side, I came once more to overlook
the upper surface of the fog; but it wore a different appearance
from what I had beheld at daybreak.&nbsp; For, first, the sun now
fell on it from high overhead, and its surface shone and
undulated like a great nor&rsquo;land moor country, sheeted with
untrodden morning snow.&nbsp; And next the new level must have
been a thousand or fifteen hundred feet higher than the old, so
that only five or six points of all the broken country below me,
still stood out.&nbsp; Napa valley was now one with Sonoma on the
west.&nbsp; On the hither side, only a thin scattered fringe of
bluffs was unsubmerged; and through all the gaps the fog was
pouring over, like an ocean, into the blue clear sunny country on
the east.&nbsp; There it was soon lost; for it fell instantly
into the bottom of the valleys, following the water-shed; and the
hilltops in that quarter were still clear cut upon the eastern
sky.</p>
<p>Through the Toll House gap and over the near ridges on the
other side, the deluge was immense.&nbsp; A spray of thin vapour
was thrown high above it, rising and falling, and blown into
fantastic shapes.&nbsp; The speed of its course was like a
mountain torrent.&nbsp; Here and there a few treetops were
discovered and then whelmed again; and for one second, the bough
of a dead pine beckoned out of the spray like the arm of a
drowning man.&nbsp; But still the imagination was dissatisfied,
still the ear waited for something more.&nbsp; Had this indeed
been water (as it seemed so, to the eye), with what a plunge of
reverberating thunder would it have rolled upon its course,
disembowelling mountains and deracinating pines!&nbsp; And yet
water it was, and sea-water at that&mdash;true Pacific billows,
only somewhat rarefied, rolling in mid air among the
hilltops.</p>
<p>I climbed still higher, among the red rattling gravel and
dwarf underwood of Mount Saint Helena, until I could look right
down upon Silverado, and admire the favoured nook in which it
lay.&nbsp; The sunny plain of fog was several hundred feet
higher; behind the protecting spur a gigantic accumulation of
cottony vapour threatened, with every second, to blow over and
submerge our homestead; but the vortex setting past the Toll
House was too strong; and there lay our little platform, in the
arms of the deluge, but still enjoying its unbroken
sunshine.&nbsp; About eleven, however, thin spray came flying
over the friendly buttress, and I began to think the fog had
hunted out its Jonah after all.&nbsp; But it was the last
effort.&nbsp; The wind veered while we were at dinner, and began
to blow squally from the mountain summit; and by half-past one,
all that world of sea-fogs was utterly routed and flying here and
there into the south in little rags of cloud.&nbsp; And instead
of a lone sea-beach, we found ourselves once more inhabiting a
high mountainside, with the clear green country far below us, and
the light smoke of Calistoga blowing in the air.</p>
<p>This was the great Russian campaign for that season.&nbsp; Now
and then, in the early morning, a little white lakelet of fog
would be seen far down in Napa Valley; but the heights were not
again assailed, nor was the surrounding world again shut off from
Silverado.</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>THE
TOLL HOUSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Toll House, standing alone by
the wayside under nodding pines, with its streamlet and
water-tank; its backwoods, toll-bar, and well trodden croquet
ground; the ostler standing by the stable door, chewing a straw;
a glimpse of the Chinese cook in the back parts; and Mr. Hoddy in
the bar, gravely alert and serviceable, and equally anxious to
lend or borrow books;&mdash;dozed all day in the dusty sunshine,
more than half asleep.&nbsp; There were no neighbours, except the
Hansons up the hill.&nbsp; The traffic on the road was
infinitesimal; only, at rare intervals, a couple in a waggon, or
a dusty farmer on a springboard, toiling over &ldquo;the
grade&rdquo; to that metropolitan hamlet, Calistoga; and, at the
fixed hours, the passage of the stages.</p>
<p>The nearest building was the school-house, down the road; and
the school-ma&rsquo;am boarded at the Toll House, walking thence
in the morning to the little brown shanty, where she taught the
young ones of the district, and returning thither pretty weary in
the afternoon.&nbsp; She had chosen this outlying situation, I
understood, for her health.&nbsp; Mr. Corwin was consumptive; so
was Rufe; so was Mr. Jennings, the engineer.&nbsp; In short, the
place was a kind of small Davos: consumptive folk consorting on a
hilltop in the most unbroken idleness.&nbsp; Jennings never did
anything that I could see, except now and then to fish, and
generally to sit about in the bar and the verandah, waiting for
something to happen.&nbsp; Corwin and Rufe did as little as
possible; and if the school-ma&rsquo;am, poor lady, had to work
pretty hard all morning, she subsided when it was over into much
the same dazed beatitude as all the rest.</p>
<p>Her special corner was the parlour&mdash;a very genteel room,
with Bible prints, a crayon portrait of Mrs. Corwin in the height
of fashion, a few years ago, another of her son (Mr. Corwin was
not represented), a mirror, and a selection of dried
grasses.&nbsp; A large book was laid religiously on the
table&mdash;&ldquo;From Palace to Hovel,&rdquo; I believe, its
name&mdash;full of the raciest experiences in England.&nbsp; The
author had mingled freely with all classes, the nobility
particularly meeting him with open arms; and I must say that
traveller had ill requited his reception.&nbsp; His book, in
short, was a capital instance of the Penny Messalina school of
literature; and there arose from it, in that cool parlour, in
that silent, wayside, mountain inn, a rank atmosphere of gold and
blood and &ldquo;Jenkins,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mysteries of
London,&rdquo; and sickening, inverted snobbery, fit to knock you
down.&nbsp; The mention of this book reminds me of another and
far racier picture of our island life.&nbsp; The latter parts of
<i>Rocambole</i> are surely too sparingly consulted in the
country which they celebrate.&nbsp; No man&rsquo;s education can
be said to be complete, nor can he pronounce the world yet
emptied of enjoyment, till he has made the acquaintance of
&ldquo;the Reverend Patterson, director of the Evangelical
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; To follow the evolutions of that reverend
gentleman, who goes through scenes in which even Mr. Duffield
would hesitate to place a bishop, is to rise to new ideas.&nbsp;
But, alas! there was no Patterson about the Toll House.&nbsp;
Only, alongside of &ldquo;From Palace to Hovel,&rdquo; a sixpenny
&ldquo;Ouida&rdquo; figured.&nbsp; So literature, you see, was
not unrepresented.</p>
<p>The school-ma&rsquo;am had friends to stay with her, other
school-ma&rsquo;ams enjoying their holidays, quite a bevy of
damsels.&nbsp; They seemed never to go out, or not beyond the
verandah, but sat close in the little parlour, quietly talking or
listening to the wind among the trees.&nbsp; Sleep dwelt in the
Toll House, like a fixture: summer sleep, shallow, soft, and
dreamless.&nbsp; A cuckoo-clock, a great rarity in such a place,
hooted at intervals about the echoing house; and Mr. Jenning
would open his eyes for a moment in the bar, and turn the leaf of
a newspaper, and the resting school-ma&rsquo;ams in the parlour
would be recalled to the consciousness of their inaction.&nbsp;
Busy Mrs. Corwin and her busy Chinaman might be heard indeed, in
the penetralia, pounding dough or rattling dishes; or perhaps
Rufe had called up some of the sleepers for a game of croquet,
and the hollow strokes of the mallet sounded far away among the
woods: but with these exceptions, it was sleep and sunshine and
dust, and the wind in the pine trees, all day long.</p>
<p>A little before stage time, that castle of indolence
awoke.&nbsp; The ostler threw his straw away and set to his
preparations.&nbsp; Mr. Jennings rubbed his eyes; happy Mr.
Jennings, the something he had been waiting for all day about to
happen at last!&nbsp; The boarders gathered in the verandah,
silently giving ear, and gazing down the road with shaded
eyes.&nbsp; And as yet there was no sign for the senses, not a
sound, not a tremor of the mountain road.&nbsp; The birds, to
whom the secret of the hooting cuckoo is unknown, must have set
down to instinct this premonitory bustle.</p>
<p>And then the first of the two stages swooped upon the Toll
House with a roar and in a cloud of dust; and the shock had not
yet time to subside, before the second was abreast of it.&nbsp;
Huge concerns they were, well-horsed and loaded, the men in their
shirt-sleeves, the women swathed in veils, the long whip cracking
like a pistol; and as they charged upon that slumbering hostelry,
each shepherding a dust storm, the dead place blossomed into life
and talk and clatter.&nbsp; This the Toll House?&mdash;with its
city throng, its jostling shoulders, its infinity of instant
business in the bar?&nbsp; The mind would not receive it!&nbsp;
The heartfelt bustle of that hour is hardly credible; the thrill
of the great shower of letters from the post-bag, the childish
hope and interest with which one gazed in all these
strangers&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp; They paused there but to pass: the
blue-clad China-boy, the San Francisco magnate, the mystery in
the dust coat, the secret memoirs in tweed, the ogling, well-shod
lady with her troop of girls; they did but flash and go; they
were hull-down for us behind life&rsquo;s ocean, and we but
hailed their topsails on the line.&nbsp; Yet, out of our great
solitude of four and twenty mountain hours, we thrilled to their
momentary presence gauged and divined them, loved and hated; and
stood light-headed in that storm of human electricity.&nbsp; Yes,
like Piccadilly circus, this is also one of life&rsquo;s
crossing-places.&nbsp; Here I beheld one man, already famous or
infamous, a centre of pistol-shots: and another who, if not yet
known to rumour, will fill a column of the Sunday paper when he
comes to hang&mdash;a burly, thick-set, powerful Chinese
desperado, six long bristles upon either lip; redolent of
whiskey, playing cards, and pistols; swaggering in the bar with
the lowest assumption of the lowest European manners; rapping out
blackguard English oaths in his canorous oriental voice; and
combining in one person the depravities of two races and two
civilizations.&nbsp; For all his lust and vigour, he seemed to
look cold upon me from the valley of the shadow of the
gallows.&nbsp; He imagined a vain thing; and while he drained his
cock-tail, Holbein&rsquo;s death was at his elbow.&nbsp; Once,
too, I fell in talk with another of these flitting
strangers&mdash;like the rest, in his shirt-sleeves and all
begrimed with dust&mdash;and the next minute we were discussing
Paris and London, theatres and wines.&nbsp; To him, journeying
from one human place to another, this was a trifle; but to
me!&nbsp; No, Mr. Lillie, I have not forgotten it.</p>
<p>And presently the city-tide was at its flood and began to
ebb.&nbsp; Life runs in Piccadilly Circus, say, from nine to one,
and then, there also, ebbs into the small hours of the echoing
policeman and the lamps and stars.&nbsp; But the Toll House is
far up stream, and near its rural springs; the bubble of the tide
but touches it.&nbsp; Before you had yet grasped your pleasure,
the horses were put to, the loud whips volleyed, and the tide was
gone.&nbsp; North and south had the two stages vanished, the
towering dust subsided in the woods; but there was still an
interval before the flush had fallen on your cheeks, before the
ear became once more contented with the silence, or the seven
sleepers of the Toll House dozed back to their accustomed
corners.&nbsp; Yet a little, and the ostler would swing round the
great barrier across the road; and in the golden evening, that
dreamy inn begin to trim its lamps and spread the board for
supper.</p>
<p>As I recall the place&mdash;the green dell below; the spires
of pine; the sun-warm, scented air; that gray, gabled inn, with
its faint stirrings of life amid the slumber of the
mountains&mdash;I slowly awake to a sense of admiration,
gratitude, and almost love.&nbsp; A fine place, after all, for a
wasted life to doze away in&mdash;the cuckoo clock hooting of its
far home country; the croquet mallets, eloquent of English lawns;
the stages daily bringing news of&mdash;the turbulent world away
below there; and perhaps once in the summer, a salt fog pouring
overhead with its tale of the Pacific.</p>
<h2><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>A
STARRY DRIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> our rule at Silverado, there was
a melancholy interregnum.&nbsp; The queen and the crown prince
with one accord fell sick; and, as I was sick to begin with, our
lone position on Mount Saint Helena was no longer tenable, and we
had to hurry back to Calistoga and a cottage on the green.&nbsp;
By that time we had begun to realize the difficulties of our
position.&nbsp; We had found what an amount of labour it cost to
support life in our red canyon; and it was the dearest desire of
our hearts to get a China-boy to go along with us when we
returned.&nbsp; We could have given him a whole house to himself,
self-contained, as they say in the advertisements; and on the
money question we were prepared to go far.&nbsp; Kong Sam Kee,
the Calistoga washerman, was entrusted with the affair; and from
day to day it languished on, with protestations on our part and
mellifluous excuses on the part of Kong Sam Kee.</p>
<p>At length, about half-past eight of our last evening, with the
waggon ready harnessed to convey us up the grade, the washerman,
with a somewhat sneering air, produced the boy.&nbsp; He was a
handsome, gentlemanly lad, attired in rich dark blue, and shod
with snowy white; but, alas! he had heard rumours of
Silverado.&nbsp; He know it for a lone place on the
mountain-side, with no friendly wash-house near by, where he
might smoke a pipe of opium o&rsquo; nights with other
China-boys, and lose his little earnings at the game of tan; and
he first backed out for more money; and then, when that demand
was satisfied, refused to come point-blank.&nbsp; He was wedded
to his wash-houses; he had no taste for the rural life; and we
must go to our mountain servantless.&nbsp; It must have been near
half an hour before we reached that conclusion, standing in the
midst of Calistoga high street under the stars, and the China-boy
and Kong Sam Kee singing their pigeon English in the sweetest
voices and with the most musical inflections.</p>
<p>We were not, however, to return alone; for we brought with us
Joe Strong, the painter, a most good-natured comrade and a
capital hand at an omelette.&nbsp; I do not know in which
capacity he was most valued&mdash;as a cook or a companion; and
he did excellently well in both.</p>
<p>The Kong Sam Kee negotiation had delayed us unduly; it must
have been half-past nine before we left Calistoga, and night came
fully ere we struck the bottom of the grade.&nbsp; I have never
seen such a night.&nbsp; It seemed to throw calumny in the teeth
of all the painters that ever dabbled in starlight.&nbsp; The sky
itself was of a ruddy, powerful, nameless, changing colour, dark
and glossy like a serpent&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The stars, by
innumerable millions, stuck boldly forth like lamps.&nbsp; The
milky way was bright, like a moonlit cloud; half heaven seemed
milky way.&nbsp; The greater luminaries shone each more clearly
than a winter&rsquo;s moon.&nbsp; Their light was dyed in every
sort of colour&mdash;red, like fire; blue, like steel; green,
like the tracks of sunset; and so sharply did each stand forth in
its own lustre that there was no appearance of that flat,
star-spangled arch we know so well in pictures, but all the
hollow of heaven was one chaos of contesting luminaries&mdash;a
hurry-burly of stars.&nbsp; Against this the hills and rugged
treetops stood out redly dark.</p>
<p>As we continued to advance, the lesser lights and milky ways
first grew pale, and then vanished; the countless hosts of heaven
dwindled in number by successive millions; those that still shone
had tempered their exceeding brightness and fallen back into
their customary wistful distance; and the sky declined from its
first bewildering splendour into the appearance of a common
night.&nbsp; Slowly this change proceeded, and still there was no
sign of any cause.&nbsp; Then a whiteness like mist was thrown
over the spurs of the mountain.&nbsp; Yet a while, and, as we
turned a corner, a great leap of silver light and net of forest
shadows fell across the road and upon our wondering waggonful;
and, swimming low among the trees, we beheld a strange,
misshapen, waning moon, half-tilted on her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye when the moon appears?&rdquo; so the old
poet sang, half-taunting, to the stars, bent upon a courtly
purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As the sunlight round the dim earth&rsquo;s
midnight tower of shadow pours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Streaming past the dim, wide portals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewless to the eyes of mortals,<br />
Till it floods the moon&rsquo;s pale islet or the morning&rsquo;s
golden shores.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sings Mr. Trowbridge, with a noble inspiration.&nbsp; And
so had the sunlight flooded that pale islet of the moon, and her
lit face put out, one after another, that galaxy of stars.&nbsp;
The wonder of the drive was over; but, by some nice conjunction
of clearness in the air and fit shadow in the valley where we
travelled, we had seen for a little while that brave display of
the midnight heavens.&nbsp; It was gone, but it had been; nor
shall I ever again behold the stars with the same mind.&nbsp; He
who has seen the sea commoved with a great hurricane, thinks of
it very differently from him who has seen it only in a
calm.&nbsp; And the difference between a calm and a hurricane is
not greatly more striking than that between the ordinary face of
night and the splendour that shone upon us in that drive.&nbsp;
Two in our waggon knew night as she shines upon the tropics, but
even that bore no comparison.&nbsp; The nameless colour of the
sky, the hues of the star-fire, and the incredible projection of
the stars themselves, starting from their orbits, so that the eye
seemed to distinguish their positions in the hollow of
space&mdash;these were things that we had never seen before and
shall never see again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in this altered night, we proceeded on our way
among the scents and silence of the forest, reached the top of
the grade, wound up by Hanson&rsquo;s, and came at last to a
stand under the flying gargoyle of the chute.&nbsp; Sam, who had
been lying back, fast asleep, with the moon on his face, got
down, with the remark that it was pleasant &ldquo;to be
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; The waggon turned and drove away, the noise
gently dying in the woods, and we clambered up the rough path,
Caliban&rsquo;s great feat of engineering, and came home to
Silverado.</p>
<p>The moon shone in at the eastern doors and windows, and over
the lumber on the platform.&nbsp; The one tall pine beside the
ledge was steeped in silver.&nbsp; Away up the canyon, a wild cat
welcomed us with three discordant squalls.&nbsp; But once we had
lit a candle, and began to review our improvements, homely in
either sense, and count our stores, it was wonderful what a
feeling of possession and permanence grow up in the hearts of the
lords of Silverado.&nbsp; A bed had still to be made up for
Strong, and the morning&rsquo;s water to be fetched, with
clinking pail; and as we set about these household duties, and
showed off our wealth and conveniences before the stranger, and
had a glass of wine, I think, in honour of our return, and
trooped at length one after another up the flying bridge of
plank, and lay down to sleep in our shattered, moon-pierced
barrack, we were among the happiest sovereigns in the world, and
certainly ruled over the most contented people.&nbsp; Yet, in our
absence, the palace had been sacked.&nbsp; Wild cats, so the
Hansons said, had broken in and carried off a side of bacon, a
hatchet, and two knives.</p>

197</span>EPISODES IN THE STORY OF A MINE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one could live at Silverado and
not be curious about the story of the mine.&nbsp; We were
surrounded by so many evidences of expense and toil, we lived so
entirely in the wreck of that great enterprise, like mites in the
ruins of a cheese, that the idea of the old din and bustle
haunted our repose.&nbsp; Our own house, the forge, the dump, the
chutes, the rails, the windlass, the mass of broken plant; the
two tunnels, one far below in the green dell, the other on the
platform where we kept our wine; the deep shaft, with the
sun-glints and the water-drops; above all, the ledge, that great
gaping slice out of the mountain shoulder, propped apart by
wooden wedges, on whose immediate margin, high above our heads,
the one tall pine precariously nodded&mdash;these stood for its
greatness; while, the dog-hutch, boot-jacks, old boots, old
tavern bills, and the very beds that we inherited from bygone
miners, put in human touches and realized for us the story of the
past.</p>
<p>I have sat on an old sleeper, under the thick madronas near
the forge, with just a look over the dump on the green world
below, and seen the sun lying broad among the wreck, and heard
the silence broken only by the tinkling water in the shaft, or a
stir of the royal family about the battered palace, and my mind
has gone back to the epoch of the Stanleys and the Chapmans, with
a grand <i>tutti</i> of pick and drill, hammer and anvil, echoing
about the canyon; the assayer hard at it in our dining-room; the
carts below on the road, and their cargo of red mineral bounding
and thundering down the iron chute.&nbsp; And now all
gone&mdash;all fallen away into this sunny silence and desertion:
a family of squatters dining in the assayer&rsquo;s office,
making their beds in the big sleeping room erstwhile so crowded,
keeping their wine in the tunnel that once rang with picks.</p>
<p>But Silverado itself, although now fallen in its turn into
decay, was once but a mushroom, and had succeeded to other mines
and other flitting cities.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, away down the
glen on the Lake County side there was a place, Jonestown by
name, with two thousand inhabitants dwelling under canvas, and
one roofed house for the sale of whiskey.&nbsp; Round on the
western side of Mount Saint Helena, there was at the same date, a
second large encampment, its name, if it ever had one, lost for
me.&nbsp; Both of these have perished, leaving not a stick and
scarce a memory behind them.&nbsp; Tide after tide of hopeful
miners have thus flowed and ebbed about the mountain, coming and
going, now by lone prospectors, now with a rush.&nbsp; Last, in
order of time came Silverado, reared the big mill, in the valley,
founded the town which is now represented, monumentally, by
Hanson&rsquo;s, pierced all these slaps and shafts and tunnels,
and in turn declined and died away.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our noisy years seem moments in the wake<br
/>
Of the eternal silence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the success of Silverado in its time of being, two
reports were current.&nbsp; According to the first, six hundred
thousand dollars were taken out of that great upright seam, that
still hung open above us on crazy wedges.&nbsp; Then the ledge
pinched out, and there followed, in quest of the remainder, a
great drifting and tunnelling in all directions, and a great
consequent effusion of dollars, until, all parties being sick of
the expense, the mine was deserted, and the town decamped.&nbsp;
According to the second version, told me with much secrecy of
manner, the whole affair, mine, mill, and town, were parts of one
majestic swindle.&nbsp; There had never come any silver out of
any portion of the mine; there was no silver to come.&nbsp; At
midnight trains of packhorses might have been observed winding by
devious tracks about the shoulder of the mountain.&nbsp; They
came from far away, from Amador or Placer, laden with silver in
&ldquo;old cigar boxes.&rdquo;&nbsp; They discharged their load
at Silverado, in the hour of sleep; and before the morning they
were gone again with their mysterious drivers to their unknown
source.&nbsp; In this way, twenty thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of
silver was smuggled in under cover of night, in these old cigar
boxes; mixed with Silverado mineral; carted down to the mill;
crushed, amalgated, and refined, and despatched to the city as
the proper product of the mine.&nbsp; Stock-jobbing, if it can
cover such expenses, must be a profitable business in San
Francisco.</p>
<p>I give these two versions as I got them.&nbsp; But I place
little reliance on either, my belief in history having been
greatly shaken.&nbsp; For it chanced that I had come to dwell in
Silverado at a critical hour; great events in its history were
about to happen&mdash;did happen, as I am led to believe; nay,
and it will be seen that I played a part in that revolution
myself.&nbsp; And yet from first to last I never had a glimmer of
an idea what was going on; and even now, after full reflection,
profess myself at sea.&nbsp; That there was some obscure intrigue
of the cigar-box order, and that I, in the character of a wooden
puppet, set pen to paper in the interest of somebody, so much,
and no more, is certain.</p>
<p>Silverado, then under my immediate sway, belonged to one whom
I will call a Mr. Ronalds.&nbsp; I only knew him through the
extraordinarily distorting medium of local gossip, now as a
momentous jobber; now as a dupe to point an adage; and again, and
much more probably, as an ordinary Christian gentleman like you
or me, who had opened a mine and worked it for a while with
better and worse fortune.&nbsp; So, through a defective
window-pane, you may see the passer-by shoot up into a
hunchbacked giant or dwindle into a potbellied dwarf.</p>
<p>To Ronalds, at least, the mine belonged; but the notice by
which he held it would ran out upon the 30th of June&mdash;or
rather, as I suppose, it had run out already, and the month of
grace would expire upon that day, after which any American
citizen might post a notice of his own, and make Silverado
his.&nbsp; This, with a sort of quiet slyness, Rufe told me at an
early period of our acquaintance.&nbsp; There was no silver, of
course; the mine &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t worth nothing, Mr.
Stevens,&rdquo; but there was a deal of old iron and wood around,
and to gain possession of this old wood and iron, and get a right
to the water, Rufe proposed, if I had no objections, to
&ldquo;jump the claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, I had no objection.&nbsp; But I was filled with
wonder.&nbsp; If all he wanted was the wood and iron, what, in
the name of fortune, was to prevent him taking them?&nbsp;
&ldquo;His right there was none to dispute.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might
lay hands on all to-morrow, as the wild cats had laid hands upon
our knives and hatchet.&nbsp; Besides, was this mass of heavy
mining plant worth transportation?&nbsp; If it was, why had not
the rightful owners carted it away?&nbsp; If it was, would they
not preserve their title to these movables, even after they had
lost their title to the mine?&nbsp; And if it were not, what the
better was Rufe?&nbsp; Nothing would grow at Silverado; there was
even no wood to cut; beyond a sense of property, there was
nothing to be gained.&nbsp; Lastly, was it at all credible that
Ronalds would forget what Rufe remembered?&nbsp; The days of
grace were not yet over: any fine morning he might appear, paper
in hand, and enter for another year on his inheritance.&nbsp;
However, it was none of my business; all seemed legal; Rufe or
Ronalds, all was one to me.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 27th, Mrs. Hanson appeared with the milk
as usual, in her sun-bonnet.&nbsp; The time would be out on
Tuesday, she reminded us, and bade me be in readiness to play my
part, though I had no idea what it was to be.&nbsp; And suppose
Ronalds came? we asked.&nbsp; She received the idea with
derision, laughing aloud with all her fine teeth.&nbsp; He could
not find the mine to save his life, it appeared, without Rufe to
guide him.&nbsp; Last year, when he came, they heard him
&ldquo;up and down the road a hollerin&rsquo; and a raisin&rsquo;
Cain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at last he had to come to the Hansons in
despair, and bid Rufe, &ldquo;Jump into your pants and shoes, and
show me where this old mine is, anyway!&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing that
Ronalds had laid out so much money in the spot, and that a beaten
road led right up to the bottom of the clump, I thought this a
remarkable example.&nbsp; The sense of locality must be
singularly in abeyance in the case of Ronalds.</p>
<p>That same evening, supper comfortably over, Joe Strong busy at
work on a drawing of the dump and the opposite hills, we were all
out on the platform together, sitting there, under the tented
heavens, with the same sense of privacy as if we had been cabined
in a parlour, when the sound of brisk footsteps came mounting up
the path.&nbsp; We pricked our ears at this, for the tread seemed
lighter and firmer than was usual with our country
neighbours.&nbsp; And presently, sure enough, two town gentlemen,
with cigars and kid gloves, came debauching past the house.&nbsp;
They looked in that place like a blasphemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; they said.&nbsp; For none of us
had stirred; we all sat stiff with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; I returned; and then, to put them
at their ease, &ldquo;A stiff climb,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the leader; &ldquo;but we have to
thank you for this path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not like the man&rsquo;s tone.&nbsp; None of us liked
it.&nbsp; He did not seem embarrassed by the meeting, but threw
us his remarks like favours, and strode magisterially by us
towards the shaft and tunnel.</p>
<p>Presently we heard his voice raised to his companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We drifted every sort of way, but couldn&rsquo;t strike
the ledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then again: &ldquo;It pinched out
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And once more: &ldquo;Every minor that ever
worked upon it says there&rsquo;s bound to be a ledge
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the snatches of his talk that reached us, and they
had a damning significance.&nbsp; We, the lords of Silverado, had
come face to face with our superior.&nbsp; It is the worst of all
quaint and of all cheap ways of life that they bring us at last
to the pinch of some humiliation.&nbsp; I liked well enough to be
a squatter when there was none but Hanson by; before Ronalds, I
will own, I somewhat quailed.&nbsp; I hastened to do him fealty,
said I gathered he was the Squattee, and apologized.&nbsp; He
threatened me with ejection, in a manner grimly
pleasant&mdash;more pleasant to him, I fancy, than to me; and
then he passed off into praises of the former state of
Silverado.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the busiest little mining town you
ever saw:&rdquo; a population of between a thousand and fifteen
hundred souls, the engine in full blast, the mill newly erected;
nothing going but champagne, and hope the order of the day.&nbsp;
Ninety thousand dollars came out; a hundred and forty thousand
were put in, making a net loss of fifty thousand.&nbsp; The last
days, I gathered, the days of John Stanley, were not so bright;
the champagne had ceased to flow, the population was already
moving elsewhere, and Silverado had begun to wither in the branch
before it was cut at the root.&nbsp; The last shot that was fired
knocked over the stove chimney, and made that hole in the roof of
our barrack, through which the sun was wont to visit slug-a-beds
towards afternoon.&nbsp; A noisy, last shot, to inaugurate the
days of silence.</p>
<p>Throughout this interview, my conscience was a good deal
exercised; and I was moved to throw myself on my knees and own
the intended treachery.&nbsp; But then I had Hanson to
consider.&nbsp; I was in much the same position as Old Rowley,
that royal humourist, whom &ldquo;the rogue had taken into his
confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, here was Ronalds on the
spot.&nbsp; He must know the day of the month as well as Hanson
and I.&nbsp; If a broad hint were necessary, he had the broadest
in the world.&nbsp; For a large board had been nailed by the
crown prince on the very front of our house, between the door and
window, painted in cinnabar&mdash;the pigment of the
country&mdash;with doggrel rhymes and contumelious pictures, and
announcing, in terms unnecessarily figurative, that the trick was
already played, the claim already jumped, and Master Sam the
legitimate successor of Mr. Ronalds.&nbsp; But no, nothing could
save that man; <i>quem deus vult perdere</i>, <i>prius
dementat</i>.&nbsp; As he came so he went, and left his rights
depending.</p>
<p>Late at night, by Silverado reckoning, and after we were all
abed, Mrs. Hanson returned to give us the newest of her
news.&nbsp; It was like a scene in a ship&rsquo;s steerage: all
of us abed in our different tiers, the single candle struggling
with the darkness, and this plump, handsome woman, seated on an
upturned valise beside the bunks, talking and showing her fine
teeth, and laughing till the rafters rang.&nbsp; Any ship, to be
sure, with a hundredth part as many holes in it as our barrack,
must long ago have gone to her last port.&nbsp; Up to that time I
had always imagined Mrs. Hanson&rsquo;s loquacity to be mere
incontinence, that she said what was uppermost for the pleasure
of speaking, and laughed and laughed again as a kind of musical
accompaniment.&nbsp; But I now found there was an art in it, I
found it less communicative than silence itself.&nbsp; I wished
to know why Ronalds had come; how he had found his way without
Rufe; and why, being on the spot, he had not refreshed his
title.&nbsp; She talked interminably on, but her replies were
never answers.&nbsp; She fled under a cloud of words; and when I
had made sure that she was purposely eluding me, I dropped the
subject in my turn, and let her rattle where she would.</p>
<p>She had come to tell us that, instead of waiting for Tuesday,
the claim was to be jumped on the morrow.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; If the
time were not out, it was impossible.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If Ronalds
had come and gone, and done nothing, there was the less cause for
hurry.&nbsp; But again I could reach no satisfaction.&nbsp; The
claim was to be jumped next morning, that was all that she would
condescend upon.</p>
<p>And yet it was not jumped the next morning, nor yet the next,
and a whole week had come and gone before we heard more of this
exploit.&nbsp; That day week, however, a day of great heat,
Hanson, with a little roll of paper in his hand, and the eternal
pipe alight; Breedlove, his large, dull friend, to act, I
suppose, as witness; Mrs. Hanson, in her Sunday best; and all the
children, from the oldest to the youngest;&mdash;arrived in a
procession, tailing one behind another up the path.&nbsp; Caliban
was absent, but he had been chary of his friendly visits since
the row; and with that exception, the whole family was gathered
together as for a marriage or a christening.&nbsp; Strong was
sitting at work, in the shade of the dwarf madronas near the
forge; and they planted themselves about him in a circle, one on
a stone, another on the waggon rails, a third on a piece of
plank.&nbsp; Gradually the children stole away up the canyon to
where there was another chute, somewhat smaller than the one
across the dump; and down this chute, for the rest of the
afternoon, they poured one avalanche of stones after another,
waking the echoes of the glen.&nbsp; Meantime we elders sat
together on the platform, Hanson and his friend smoking in
silence like Indian sachems, Mrs. Hanson rattling on as usual
with an adroit volubility, saying nothing, but keeping the party
at their ease like a courtly hostess.</p>
<p>Not a word occurred about the business of the day.&nbsp; Once,
twice, and thrice I tried to slide the subject in, but was
discouraged by the stoic apathy of Rufe, and beaten down before
the pouring verbiage of his wife.&nbsp; There is nothing of the
Indian brave about me, and I began to grill with
impatience.&nbsp; At last, like a highway robber, I cornered
Hanson, and bade him stand and deliver his business.&nbsp;
Thereupon he gravely rose, as though to hint that this was not a
proper place, nor the subject one suitable for squaws, and I,
following his example, led him up the plank into our
barrack.&nbsp; There he bestowed himself on a box, and unrolled
his papers with fastidious deliberation.&nbsp; There were two
sheets of note-paper, and an old mining notice, dated May 30th,
1879, part print, part manuscript, and the latter much
obliterated by the rains.&nbsp; It was by this identical piece of
paper that the mine had been held last year.&nbsp; For thirteen
months it had endured the weather and the change of seasons on a
cairn behind the shoulder of the canyon; and it was now my
business, spreading it before me on the table, and sitting on a
valise, to copy its terms, with some necessary changes, twice
over on the two sheets of note-paper.&nbsp; One was then to be
placed on the same cairn&mdash;a &ldquo;mound of rocks&rdquo; the
notice put it; and the other to be lodged for registration.</p>
<p>Rufe watched me, silently smoking, till I came to the place
for the locator&rsquo;s name at the end of the first copy; and
when I proposed that he should sign, I thought I saw a scare in
his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll be
necessary,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;just you write it
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps this mighty hunter, who was the most
active member of the local school board, could not write.&nbsp;
There would be nothing strange in that.&nbsp; The constable of
Calistoga is, and has been for years, a bed-ridden man, and, if I
remember rightly, blind.&nbsp; He had more need of the emoluments
than another, it was explained; and it was easy for him to
&ldquo;depytize,&rdquo; with a strong accent on the last.&nbsp;
So friendly and so free are popular institutions.</p>
<p>When I had done my scrivening, Hanson strolled out, and
addressed Breedlove, &ldquo;Will you step up here a bit?&rdquo;
and after they had disappeared a little while into the chaparral
and madrona thicket, they came back again, minus a notice, and
the deed was done.&nbsp; The claim was jumped; a tract of
mountain-side, fifteen hundred feet long by six hundred wide,
with all the earth&rsquo;s precious bowels, had passed from
Ronalds to Hanson, and, in the passage, changed its name from the
&ldquo;Mammoth&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Calistoga.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had
tried to get Rufe to call it after his wife, after himself, and
after Garfield, the Republican Presidential candidate of the
hour&mdash;since then elected, and, alas! dead&mdash;but all was
in vain.&nbsp; The claim had once been called the Calistoga
before, and he seemed to feel safety in returning to that.</p>
<p>And so the history of that mine became once more plunged in
darkness, lit only by some monster pyrotechnical displays of
gossip.&nbsp; And perhaps the most curious feature of the whole
matter is this: that we should have dwelt in this quiet corner of
the mountains, with not a dozen neighbours, and yet struggled all
the while, like desperate swimmers, in this sea of falsities and
contradictions.&nbsp; Wherever a man is, there will be a lie.</p>
<h2><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>TOILS AND PLEASURES</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">must</span> try to convey some notion of
our life, of how the days passed and what pleasure we took in
them, of what there was to do and how we set about doing it, in
our mountain hermitage.&nbsp; The house, after we had repaired
the worst of the damages, and filled in some of the doors and
windows with white cotton cloth, became a healthy and a pleasant
dwelling-place, always airy and dry, and haunted by the outdoor
perfumes of the glen.&nbsp; Within, it had the look of
habitation, the human look.&nbsp; You had only to go into the
third room, which we did not use, and see its stones, its sifting
earth, its tumbled litter; and then return to our lodging, with
the beds made, the plates on the rack, the pail of bright water
behind the door, the stove crackling in a corner, and perhaps the
table roughly laid against a meal,&mdash;and man&rsquo;s order,
the little clean spots that he creates to dwell in, were at once
contrasted with the rich passivity of nature.&nbsp; And yet our
house was everywhere so wrecked and shattered, the air came and
went so freely, the sun found so many portholes, the golden
outdoor glow shone in so many open chinks, that we enjoyed, at
the same time, some of the comforts of a roof and much of the
gaiety and brightness of al fresco life.&nbsp; A single shower of
rain, to be sure, and we should have been drowned out like
mice.&nbsp; But ours was a Californian summer, and an earthquake
was a far likelier accident than a shower of rain.</p>
<p>Trustful in this fine weather, we kept the house for kitchen
and bedroom, and used the platform as our summer parlour.&nbsp;
The sense of privacy, as I have said already, was complete.&nbsp;
We could look over the clump on miles of forest and rough
hilltop; our eyes commanded some of Napa Valley, where the train
ran, and the little country townships sat so close together along
the line of the rail.&nbsp; But here there was no man to
intrude.&nbsp; None but the Hansons were our visitors.&nbsp; Even
they came but at long intervals, or twice daily, at a stated
hour, with milk.&nbsp; So our days, as they were never
interrupted, drew out to the greater length; hour melted
insensibly into hour; the household duties, though they were
many, and some of them laborious, dwindled into mere islets of
business in a sea of sunny day-time; and it appears to me,
looking back, as though the far greater part of our life at
Silverado had been passed, propped upon an elbow, or seated on a
plank, listening to the silence that there is among the
hills.</p>
<p>My work, it is true, was over early in the morning.&nbsp; I
rose before any one else, lit the stove, put on the water to
boil, and strolled forth upon the platform to wait till it was
ready.&nbsp; Silverado would then be still in shadow, the sun
shining on the mountain higher up.&nbsp; A clean smell of trees,
a smell of the earth at morning, hung in the air.&nbsp;
Regularly, every day, there was a single bird, not singing, but
awkwardly chirruping among the green madronas, and the sound was
cheerful, natural, and stirring.&nbsp; It did not hold the
attention, nor interrupt the thread of meditation, like a
blackbird or a nightingale; it was mere woodland prattle, of
which the mind was conscious like a perfume.&nbsp; The freshness
of these morning seasons remained with me far on into the
day.</p>
<p>As soon as the kettle boiled, I made porridge and coffee; and
that, beyond the literal drawing of water, and the preparation of
kindling, which it would be hyperbolical to call the hewing of
wood, ended my domestic duties for the day.&nbsp; Thenceforth my
wife laboured single-handed in the palace, and I lay or wandered
on the platform at my own sweet will.&nbsp; The little corner
near the forge, where we found a refuge under the madronas from
the unsparing early sun, is indeed connected in my mind with some
nightmare encounters over Euclid, and the Latin Grammar.&nbsp;
These were known as Sam&rsquo;s lessons.&nbsp; He was supposed to
be the victim and the sufferer; but here there must have been
some misconception, for whereas I generally retired to bed after
one of these engagements, he was no sooner set free than he
dashed up to the Chinaman&rsquo;s house, where he had installed a
printing press, that great element of civilization, and the sound
of his labours would be faintly audible about the canyon half the
day.</p>
<p>To walk at all was a laborious business; the foot sank and
slid, the boots were cut to pieces, among sharp, uneven, rolling
stones.&nbsp; When we crossed the platform in any direction, it
was usual to lay a course, following as much as possible the line
of waggon rails.&nbsp; Thus, if water were to be drawn, the
water-carrier left the house along some tilting planks that we
had laid down, and not laid down very well.&nbsp; These carried
him to that great highroad, the railway; and the railway served
him as far as to the head of the shaft.&nbsp; But from thence to
the spring and back again he made the best of his unaided way,
staggering among the stones, and wading in low growth of the
calcanthus, where the rattlesnakes lay hissing at his
passage.&nbsp; Yet I liked to draw water.&nbsp; It was pleasant
to dip the gray metal pail into the clean, colourless, cool
water; pleasant to carry it back, with the water ripping at the
edge, and a broken sunbeam quivering in the midst.</p>
<p>But the extreme roughness of the walking confined us in common
practice to the platform, and indeed to those parts of it that
were most easily accessible along the line of rails.&nbsp; The
rails came straight forward from the shaft, here and there
overgrown with little green bushes, but still entire, and still
carrying a truck, which it was Sam&rsquo;s delight to trundle to
and fro by the hour with various ladings.&nbsp; About midway down
the platform, the railroad trended to the right, leaving our
house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the
madronas and the forge, and not far of the latter, ended in a
sort of platform on the edge of the dump.&nbsp; There, in old
days, the trucks were tipped, and their load sent thundering down
the chute.&nbsp; There, besides, was the only spot where we could
approach the margin of the dump.&nbsp; Anywhere else, you took
your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a
half to peer over.&nbsp; For at any moment the dump might begin
to slide and carry you down and bury you below its ruins.&nbsp;
Indeed, the neighbourhood of an old mine is a place beset with
dangers.&nbsp; For as still as Silverado was, at any moment the
report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen
into the shaft; the dump might begin to pour into the road below;
or a wedge slip in the great upright seam, and hundreds of tons
of mountain bury the scene of our encampment.</p>
<p>I have already compared the dump to a rampart, built certainly
by some rude people, and for prehistoric wars.&nbsp; It was
likewise a frontier.&nbsp; All below was green and woodland, the
tall pines soaring one above another, each with a firm outline
and full spread of bough.&nbsp; All above was arid, rocky, and
bald.&nbsp; The great spout of broken mineral, that had dammed
the canyon up, was a creature of man&rsquo;s handiwork, its
material dug out with a pick and powder, and spread by the
service of the tracks.&nbsp; But nature herself, in that upper
district, seemed to have had an eye to nothing besides mining;
and even the natural hill-side was all sliding gravel and
precarious boulder.&nbsp; Close at the margin of the well leaves
would decay to skeletons and mummies, which at length some
stronger gust would carry clear of the canyon and scatter in the
subjacent woods.&nbsp; Even moisture and decaying vegetable
matter could not, with all nature&rsquo;s alchemy, concoct enough
soil to nourish a few poor grasses.&nbsp; It is the same, they
say, in the neighbourhood of all silver mines; the nature of that
precious rock being stubborn with quartz and poisonous with
cinnabar.&nbsp; Both were plenty in our Silverado.&nbsp; The
stones sparkled white in the sunshine with quartz; they were all
stained red with cinnabar.&nbsp; Here, doubtless, came the
Indians of yore to paint their faces for the war-path; and
cinnabar, if I remember rightly, was one of the few articles of
Indian commerce.&nbsp; Now, Sam had it in his undisturbed
possession, to pound down and slake, and paint his rude designs
with.&nbsp; But to me it had always a fine flavour of poetry,
compounded out of Indian story and Hawthornden&rsquo;s
allusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Desire, alas! I desire a Zeuxis new,<br />
From Indies borrowing gold, from Eastern skies<br />
Most bright cinoper . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this is but half the picture; our Silverado platform has
another side to it.&nbsp; Though there was no soil, and scarce a
blade of grass, yet out of these tumbled gravel-heaps and broken
boulders, a flower garden bloomed as at home in a
conservatory.&nbsp; Calcanthus crept, like a hardy weed, all over
our rough parlour, choking the railway, and pushing forth its
rusty, aromatic cones from between two blocks of shattered
mineral.&nbsp; Azaleas made a big snow-bed just above the
well.&nbsp; The shoulder of the hill waved white with
Mediterranean heath.&nbsp; In the crannies of the ledge and about
the spurs of the tall pine, a red flowering stone-plant hung in
clusters.&nbsp; Even the low, thorny chaparral was thick with
pea-like blossom.&nbsp; Close at the foot of our path nutmegs
prospered, delightful to the sight and smell.&nbsp; At sunrise,
and again late at night, the scent of the sweet bay trees filled
the canyon, and the down-blowing night wind must have borne it
hundreds of feet into the outer air.</p>
<p>All this vegetation, to be sure, was stunted.&nbsp; The
madrona was here no bigger than the manzanita; the bay was but a
stripling shrub; the very pines, with four or five exceptions in
all our upper canyon, were not so tall as myself, or but a little
taller, and the most of them came lower than my waist.&nbsp; For
a prosperous forest tree, we must look below, where the glen was
crowded with green spires.&nbsp; But for flowers and ravishing
perfume, we had none to envy: our heap of road-metal was thick
with bloom, like a hawthorn in the front of June; our red, baking
angle in the mountain, a laboratory of poignant scents.&nbsp; It
was an endless wonder to my mind, as I dreamed about the
platform, following the progress of the shadows, where the
madrona with its leaves, the azalea and calcanthus with their
blossoms, could find moisture to support such thick, wet, waxy
growths, or the bay tree collect the ingredients of its
perfume.&nbsp; But there they all grew together, healthy, happy,
and happy-making, as though rooted in a fathom of black soil.</p>
<p>Nor was it only vegetable life that prospered.&nbsp; We had,
indeed, few birds, and none that had much of a voice or anything
worthy to be called a song.&nbsp; My morning comrade had a thin
chirp, unmusical and monotonous, but friendly and pleasant to
hear.&nbsp; He had but one rival: a fellow with an ostentatious
cry of near an octave descending, not one note of which properly
followed another.&nbsp; This is the only bird I ever knew with a
wrong ear; but there was something enthralling about his
performance.&nbsp; You listened and listened, thinking each time
he must surely get it right; but no, it was always wrong, and
always wrong the same way.&nbsp; Yet he seemed proud of his song,
delivered it with execution and a manner of his own, and was
charming to his mate.&nbsp; A very incorrect, incessant human
whistler had thus a chance of knowing how his own music pleased
the world.&nbsp; Two great birds&mdash;eagles, we
thought&mdash;dwelt at the top of the canyon, among the crags
that were printed on the sky.&nbsp; Now and again, but very
rarely, they wheeled high over our heads in silence, or with a
distant, dying scream; and then, with a fresh impulse, winged
fleetly forward, dipped over a hilltop, and were gone.&nbsp; They
seemed solemn and ancient things, sailing the blue air: perhaps
co-oeval with the mountain where they haunted, perhaps emigrants
from Rome, where the glad legions may have shouted to behold them
on the morn of battle.</p>
<p>But if birds were rare, the place abounded with
rattlesnakes&mdash;the rattlesnake&rsquo;s nest, it might have
been named.&nbsp; Wherever we brushed among the bushes, our
passage woke their angry buzz.&nbsp; One dwelt habitually in the
wood-pile, and sometimes, when we came for firewood, thrust up
his small head between two logs, and hissed at the
intrusion.&nbsp; The rattle has a legendary credit; it is said to
be awe-inspiring, and, once heard, to stamp itself for ever in
the memory.&nbsp; But the sound is not at all alarming; the hum
of many insects, and the buzz of the wasp convince the ear of
danger quite as readily.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, we lived for
weeks in Silverado, coming and going, with rattles sprung on
every side, and it never occurred to us to be afraid.&nbsp; I
used to take sun-baths and do calisthenics in a certain pleasant
nook among azalea and calcanthus, the rattles whizzing on every
side like spinning-wheels, and the combined hiss or buzz rising
louder and angrier at any sudden movement; but I was never in the
least impressed, nor ever attacked.&nbsp; It was only towards the
end of our stay, that a man down at Calistoga, who was
expatiating on the terrifying nature of the sound, gave me at
last a very good imitation; and it burst on me at once that we
dwelt in the very metropolis of deadly snakes, and that the
rattle was simply the commonest noise in Silverado.&nbsp;
Immediately on our return, we attacked the Hansons on the
subject.&nbsp; They had formerly assured us that our canyon was
favoured, like Ireland, with an entire immunity from poisonous
reptiles; but, with the perfect inconsequence of the natural man,
they were no sooner found out than they went off at score in the
contrary direction, and we were told that in no part of the world
did rattlesnakes attain to such a monstrous bigness as among the
warm, flower-dotted rocks of Silverado.&nbsp; This is a
contribution rather to the natural history of the Hansons, than
to that of snakes.</p>
<p>One person, however, better served by his instinct, had known
the rattle from the first; and that was Chuchu, the dog.&nbsp; No
rational creature has ever led an existence more poisoned by
terror than that dog&rsquo;s at Silverado.&nbsp; Every whiz of
the rattle made him bound.&nbsp; His eyes rolled; he trembled; he
would be often wet with sweat.&nbsp; One of our great mysteries
was his terror of the mountain.&nbsp; A little away above our
nook, the azaleas and almost all the vegetation ceased.&nbsp;
Dwarf pines not big enough to be Christmas trees, grew thinly
among loose stone and gravel scaurs.&nbsp; Here and there a big
boulder sat quiescent on a knoll, having paused there till the
next rain in his long slide down the mountain.&nbsp; There was
here no ambuscade for the snakes, you could see clearly where you
trod; and yet the higher I went, the more abject and appealing
became Chuchu&rsquo;s terror.&nbsp; He was an excellent master of
that composite language in which dogs communicate with men, and
he would assure me, on his honour, that there was some peril on
the mountain; appeal to me, by all that I held holy, to turn
back; and at length, finding all was in vain, and that I still
persisted, ignorantly foolhardy, he would suddenly whip round and
make a bee-line down the slope for Silverado, the gravel
showering after him.&nbsp; What was he afraid of?&nbsp; There
were admittedly brown bears and California lions on the mountain;
and a grizzly visited Rufe&rsquo;s poultry yard not long before,
to the unspeakable alarm of Caliban, who dashed out to chastise
the intruder, and found himself, by moonlight, face to face with
such a tartar.&nbsp; Something at least there must have been:
some hairy, dangerous brute lodged permanently among the rocks a
little to the north-west of Silverado, spending his summer
thereabout, with wife and family.</p>
<p>And there was, or there had been, another animal.&nbsp; Once,
under the broad daylight, on that open stony hillside, where the
baby pines were growing, scarcely tall enough to be a badge for a
MacGregor&rsquo;s bonnet, I came suddenly upon his innocent body,
lying mummified by the dry air and sun: a pigmy kangaroo.&nbsp; I
am ingloriously ignorant of these subjects; had never heard of
such a beast; thought myself face to face with some incomparable
sport of nature; and began to cherish hopes of immortality in
science.&nbsp; Rarely have I been conscious of a stranger thrill
than when I raised that singular creature from the stones, dry as
a board, his innocent heart long quiet, and all warm with
sunshine.&nbsp; His long hind legs were stiff, his tiny forepaws
clutched upon his breast, as if to leap; his poor life cut short
upon that mountain by some unknown accident.&nbsp; But the
kangaroo rat, it proved, was no such unknown animal; and my
discovery was nothing.</p>
<p>Crickets were not wanting.&nbsp; I thought I could make out
exactly four of them, each with a corner of his own, who used to
make night musical at Silverado.&nbsp; In the matter of voice,
they far excelled the birds, and their ringing whistle sounded
from rock to rock, calling and replying the same thing, as in a
meaningless opera.&nbsp; Thus, children in full health and
spirits shout together, to the dismay of neighbours; and their
idle, happy, deafening vociferations rise and fall, like the song
of the crickets.&nbsp; I used to sit at night on the platform,
and wonder why these creatures were so happy; and what was wrong
with man that he also did not wind up his days with an hour or
two of shouting; but I suspect that all long-lived animals are
solemn.&nbsp; The dogs alone are hardly used by nature; and it
seems a manifest injustice for poor Chuchu to die in his teens,
after a life so shadowed and troubled, continually shaken with
alarm, and the tear of elegant sentiment permanently in his
eye.</p>
<p>There was another neighbour of ours at Silverado, small but
very active, a destructive fellow.&nbsp; This was a black, ugly
fly&mdash;a bore, the Hansons called him&mdash;who lived by
hundreds in the boarding of our house.&nbsp; He entered by a
round hole, more neatly pierced than a man could do it with a
gimlet, and he seems to have spent his life in cutting out the
interior of the plank, but whether as a dwelling or a
store-house, I could never find.&nbsp; When I used to lie in bed
in the morning for a rest&mdash;we had no easy-chairs in
Silverado&mdash;I would hear, hour after hour, the sharp cutting
sound of his labours, and from time to time a dainty shower of
sawdust would fall upon the blankets.&nbsp; There lives no more
industrious creature than a bore.</p>
<p>And now that I have named to the reader all our animals and
insects without exception&mdash;only I find I have forgotten the
flies&mdash;he will be able to appreciate the singular privacy
and silence of our days.&nbsp; It was not only man who was
excluded: animals, the song of birds, the lowing of cattle, the
bleating of sheep, clouds even, and the variations of the
weather, were here also wanting; and as, day after day, the sky
was one dome of blue, and the pines below us stood motionless in
the still air, so the hours themselves were marked out from each
other only by the series of our own affairs, and the sun&rsquo;s
great period as he ranged westward through the heavens.&nbsp; The
two birds cackled a while in the early morning; all day the water
tinkled in the shaft, the bores ground sawdust in the planking of
our crazy palace&mdash;infinitesimal sounds; and it was only with
the return of night that any change would fall on our
surroundings, or the four crickets begin to flute together in the
dark.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be hard to exaggerate the pleasure that we
took in the approach of evening.&nbsp; Our day was not very long,
but it was very tiring.&nbsp; To trip along unsteady planks or
wade among shifting stones, to go to and fro for water, to
clamber down the glen to the Toll House after meat and letters,
to cook, to make fires and beds, were all exhausting to the
body.&nbsp; Life out of doors, besides, under the fierce eye of
day, draws largely on the animal spirits.&nbsp; There are certain
hours in the afternoon when a man, unless he is in strong health
or enjoys a vacant mind, would rather creep into a cool corner of
a house and sit upon the chairs of civilization.&nbsp; About that
time, the sharp stones, the planks, the upturned boxes of
Silverado, began to grow irksome to my body; I set out on that
hopeless, never-ending quest for a more comfortable posture; I
would be fevered and weary of the staring sun; and just then he
would begin courteously to withdraw his countenance, the shadows
lengthened, the aromatic airs awoke, and an indescribable but
happy change announced the coming of the night.</p>
<p>The hours of evening, when we were once curtained in the
friendly dark, sped lightly.&nbsp; Even as with the crickets,
night brought to us a certain spirit of rejoicing.&nbsp; It was
good to taste the air; good to mark the dawning of the stars, as
they increased their glittering company; good, too, to gather
stones, and send them crashing down the chute, a wave of
light.&nbsp; It seemed, in some way, the reward and the
fulfilment of the day.&nbsp; So it is when men dwell in the open
air; it is one of the simple pleasures that we lose by living
cribbed and covered in a house, that, though the coming of the
day is still the most inspiriting, yet day&rsquo;s departure,
also, and the return of night refresh, renew, and quiet us; and
in the pastures of the dusk we stand, like cattle, exulting in
the absence of the load.</p>
<p>Our nights wore never cold, and they were always still, but
for one remarkable exception.&nbsp; Regularly, about nine
o&rsquo;clock, a warm wind sprang up, and blew for ten minutes,
or maybe a quarter of an hour, right down the canyon, fanning it
well out, airing it as a mother airs the night nursery before the
children sleep.&nbsp; As far as I could judge, in the clear
darkness of the night, this wind was purely local: perhaps
dependant on the configuration of the glen.&nbsp; At least, it
was very welcome to the hot and weary squatters; and if we were
not abed already, the springing up of this lilliputian
valley-wind would often be our signal to retire.</p>
<p>I was the last to go to bed, as I was still the first to
rise.&nbsp; Many a night I have strolled about the platform,
taking a bath of darkness before I slept.&nbsp; The rest would be
in bed, and even from the forge I could hear them talking
together from bunk to bunk.&nbsp; A single candle in the neck of
a pint bottle was their only illumination; and yet the old
cracked house seemed literally bursting with the light.&nbsp; It
shone keen as a knife through all the vertical chinks; it struck
upward through the broken shingles; and through the eastern door
and window, it fell in a great splash upon the thicket and the
overhanging rock.&nbsp; You would have said a conflagration, or
at the least a roaring forge; and behold, it was but a
candle.&nbsp; Or perhaps it was yet more strange to see the
procession moving bedwards round the corner of the house, and up
the plank that brought us to the bedroom door; under the immense
spread of the starry heavens, down in a crevice of the giant
mountain these few human shapes, with their unshielded taper,
made so disproportionate a figure in the eye and mind.&nbsp; But
the more he is alone with nature, the greater man and his doings
bulk in the consideration of his fellow-men.&nbsp; Miles and
miles away upon the opposite hill-tops, if there were any hunter
belated or any traveller who had lost his way, he must have
stood, and watched and wondered, from the time the candle issued
from the door of the assayer&rsquo;s office till it had mounted
the plank and disappeared again into the miners&rsquo;
dormitory.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
